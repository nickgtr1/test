Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"I have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced. Ie building volumes are reducing under labor. At the same time as massive population growth.
The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 
Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 
Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked.

Hey dude. You can find the GenCost report here: 
At the topic of page 32, the first sentence on the page, it says this:

While we recognise the likely occurrence of a FOAK premium, where possible, GenCost does not include them for other technologies not yet deployed in Australia and so does not intend to do so for largescale nuclear. South Korea was identified as the best representation of a continuous building program.

My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 
My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"AAT senior member Chris Furnell said the man's case was finely balanced between protecting the Australian community against other considerations including his ties to Australia. Mr Furnell ultimately opted to cancel the revocation of the man's visa.
The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""
Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as ""inconsistent"" with Direction 99.
Asked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a ""significant emphasis on serious offending and family violence  which need to be considered in all matters"".",0

Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

There is a very slim chance for kids to get into iit and nits and govt medical colleges which are shit compared to the ones in us except a few like aiims even with a alot of hard work. Even a non Ivy League college there is miles better than top nits and govt medical colleges for technical education and medical studies. 
The biggest factor is ease of getting into us colleges as compared to indian ones due to population. 
If she wants to get into pure sciences the situation is even worse. A bachelor in science in top colleges like delhi university amounts to shit(telling from experience) compared to us. 
And lastly high school. I have some friends who did their high schooling in the us. They can vouch that the quality of high school life there is a lot better. In India hardly anyone comes to school in 11th and 12th standards in science stream as all are going coaching for competitive exams for most part of the day. It breaks kids. A lot of them end up losing friends  and feel alone.
26 kids kiled themselves in kota(coaching hub) last year. 
In 2024 7 kids have already kiled themselves. 
India is no place for kids to enjoy their life and education if you have better choices like the us.

Reddit,en-IN,Sentiment,"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves. The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.
Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.

Reddit,en-UK,Sentiment,"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.",0

This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all.
