Reddit,en-UK,Sentiment,The Conservatives could promise everyone a 20k bonus and a free mountain bike if they wanted because they won't be forming the next government so none of it will ever become reality. All this is about is generating the headlines they think will attract the attention of those voters who they think they still have a chance of retaining with the hope that it's not as bad a loss as they are fearing. There will be no substance to whatever policies they pull out of their arse.,0
Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Should have ditched trams on all but a few routes decades ago and replaced with better buses and bus services. Instead millions of dollars invested in new ones and stops. We've come too far now and there's this silly'biggest tram network in the world' pride some people have. Buses can go round things, they can pick people up from the kerb, they can be replaced when one breaks down. Trams aren't fast or frequent enough on roads with cars to replace car ownership, unless you plan on living in a 5km Melbourne bubble. 
London moves millions of people around Dickensian, two lane streets - they made hard decisions and put trains underground in London and run buses. 
All these sky rails are wasted spaces where houses could be to cope with the millions of new arrivals governments are bringing in to prop up our economy.

Reddit,en-UK,Sentiment,"Irishman here, who thoroughly enjoys celebrating St Patrick's day. 
I lived in England for a few years, and was really disappointed that St George's day wasn't widely celebrated.  In fact I would make it a personal crusade of mine to get my English mates to the pub for it. 
Having a national holiday (aside from being a great opportunity to get pissed) fosters a sense of collective belonging. It is a net positive that helps heal divisions and motivates a feeling that your community has a collective power (to fix shit).
Bigger question tho, what should'Englands Guinness' be? Nothing gets a national holiday going like the marketing might of a multinational drinks company. I'd vote for Tetleys (Edit: The Bitter not the Tea )",1
Reddit,en-UK,Sentiment,"When does anything ever go right with Rishi in power? Last time I checked a massive chunk of the current government in power is either migrants or people with more money than.

At this point I would rather have Boris back, the only thing he did wrong couldn't even be considered a petty crime.",0
Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"It should need funding, ironically, the only people who receive funding or care are those that have developed extreme forms of illness such as psychosis, or those that have already broken the law and are now on some kind of order to be treated as a result through the courts.
If you go to a hospital beforehand seeking help you will be turned around and be told to use the privatised system.
Want to see an actual psychologist long term for a clinical condition indefinitely?  Once you hit your 10 sessions you pay entirely out of your own pocket.
It's a dimly lit road, it creates its own chaos and then ironically?
Even where the chain of causality is unbroken and the government is responsible for its own mess when a man stabs over 20 people, while there are laws to punish the doctors involved with medical negligence, at a criminal level, leading to a manslaughter charge... the knives are turned on the community as a whole instead. Ironically, the entirety of Queensland Health was aware who that person was hence the causality.
What I have learned is that the government is great at knee jerk reactions, and coming up with bad responses as a result.
But to be proactive, or even retroactive and to deal with the problem from where it stems from in the lack of interest in providing clinical care, or prosecuting those that allow for these lapses? That's a nigh on impossibility, even when the cases, and reasons for action are plonked directly in the face of governments that continue the harm...
I don't have all the answers but I have one, and it would start by holding the director of Queensland Health to account for the negligent homicide of 20 innocent people in Sydney last month and rooting out every bad practitioner that refuses to treat.
Maybe that's a tough road but at this point its what it deserves...
Those types of actions are beginning in the United States through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of Tony Timpa, but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding.
On that note, not having enough funding never means:
""Blame the patient...""
But clinicians attempt to assert that repeatedly nevertheless.
""Blame the patient for turning up with a mental health complaint (or outsource it to some third party that may or may not give a fuck).",0
Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"This was me!  My boyfriend bought me a necklace that I knew I would never wear.  
I told him while I liked the necklace (white lie), I knew I'd never wear it because if I was going to wear this particular type of necklace, I'd wear the one I already owned as it held great sentimental value.  
I said I'd love it if he could return it and get a simple (far cheaper) necklace that I didn't have in my collection, but that I would cherish as more likely to wear it. 
Given the emotional connection he knew I had to the sentimental necklace, he was very gracious and was happy to exchange it.  
I didn't end up with my simple necklace, it was about 10x more expensive because he felt so bad (my tears helped lol). But i do love it.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"I'll give you a quick breakdown of dating apps in Melbourne; 
-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots
-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.
-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 
- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 
-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 
I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 
My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don't use it to date, it's frowned upon but once you get out there you'll meet people anyway. 
There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 
I am an introvert so it's perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 
I am not single luckily, I wouldn't want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. 
There are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it's so toxic.

This puts Labor in a position they're very comfortable in - lip service about the change they want, but only carrying out the changes they need (or believe they can afford) to make.
This is a fundamental issue with democracy under neoliberal and capitalist assumptions. It keeps the leftwing establishment from the proper work of nation building, keeps them ""tinkering around the edges"" as the article puts it - and allows for a ratcheting to the right of politics.
It's easy to cut taxes on wealth and big business donors. It's easy to take some money from here, put it there, to let Capitalism usurp your party's values over time. Much easier than standing up for your country, your values, or people who actually vote you in/out.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste. It's sourced from a small number of places, with a small number of providers. The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.
Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.
The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.
Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 
I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is ""Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance"" and has ""consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art"" costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 
A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn't it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn't throwing away stock. 
Perhaps I'm over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don't know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 
I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don't know what I'm talking about a I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that's as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I'm definitely not a customer of yours and I don't really care what the cost of a coffee is. I'm simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that's hardly the case now.",0

Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.
I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge. I think it's also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers - probably most of them - would happily look the other way while that happened. I would expect this to be more likely if the guy had scorned the police officers involved, because they're extremely protective of their own hurt feelings, but that's another issue altogether.
I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.
The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it. If not, they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be, and the fact that they are usually shown to be (to all practical purposes) immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.
In my opinion, if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public, you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process: that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation. We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.
If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.
I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.
I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.
Isn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?",0

That's why Labor ran on housing reform in 2013, 2016 and 2019. Yet, Australians did not believe the housing crisis existed until it hit the cities. So now we're in a fucked position. Covid LNP money printing added to the problem, too, in the way of increasing interest rates.

This has nothing to do with where the book was located.  They wanted it removed from the libraries.

One of the core features of libraries and, in my experience a point of pride to librarians, is that books be provided free of charge and free of censorship.
""The International Federation of Library Associations states that censorship ""**runs counter to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights**"". Libraries are expected to: Provide collections and services that are free of intentional censorship.""

The tenant was good and I was hoping he would stay long term. I wasn't going to increase the rent on his 1st renewal.
Anyway he's leaving a few months before his 12 month contract.
I had to option to charge him the leasing and advertising fee. I choose not to charge this but I will hold him to paying the rent until I find someone else.
I won't be picky about the new tenant as long as they have a job and reasonable rental history just like I would for any tenant. Single mothers no problems.
Even in a rental crisis It does take time to find a tenant. Just most people who want to rent a place will want to move in after 2 to 4 weeks (gives them time to exit their current living arrangement).
I've always found the winter months are harder to find a tenant as most people start their lease at the end of or start of the year.

Politicians may not really care about their donors paying less taxes, but their bosses do. I hope judges are mostly honest as they have usually decided to make less money than they would as lawyers. However, this one has shown too many signs of corruption. The people who appoint and promote judges are corrupt and McBride had secrets they wouldn't let the public know.
Also, the judge hid that sentencing was going to take place until a last minute change of plans. I believe that being more senior, more visible and less incentivised to appease politicians should mean judges of the high court are trustworthy (certainly a hundred times more trustworthy than Mossop).

Reddit,en-IN,Sentiment,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.
Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.
According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.
The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.
On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.
Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.
""You actually can't have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn't begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,"" says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.
The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"".
To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.
""They're like, 'We can't get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people',"" says Huntley.
It's not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.
Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.
Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being ""swamped by Asians"". Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being ""swamped by Muslims"".
In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were ""out of control"".
""Was I right?"" she asked her fellow senators. ""You'd never admit it, but yes I was,"" she said.
It's hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.
It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is agood thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia's immigration intake.
Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.
Lowe was president of the country's pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10years until 2014.
During that time, he tells*The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to ""prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure"". The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be ""taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment"".
""Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer  The boost to government budgets is enormous.""
So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today  as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.
Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"".
""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else.""
Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.
Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.
In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling.
""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?""
In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.
""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said.
In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.
In October 2022, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.
Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation.
Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.
Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.
""It wasn't a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister's office, and the pain of it hasn't gone away.""
""They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they're doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,"" says Dabboussy.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",0

Someone is born overseas and arrives with his parents when  he is 3 years old. He attends school through to grade 12. Later on he gets mixed up with the ""wrong crowd"" and is jailed for several years - let's say it was armed robbery. He has never left Australia - too poor to consider travelling.
At the end of his prison sentence, he is deported because he never became an Australian citizen.
In my view, he is Australian, he has no ties to that foreign country, can't even speak the language well. He has no family left in that country.
Should he be deported? Sure he's not a nice bloke, but isn't he Australia's problem?
This is the reason we should, and indeed always have in previous directions, consider ties to Australia before deporting them.
This isn't being soft as a society. This is taking responsibility for the people we brought up. Also, what happened to do the crime, do the time?

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Paywall
The NSW Coalition's most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a ""dereliction of duty"" after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.
In an extraordinary move, Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government's new laws, which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders, would pass without consultation.
The changes follow a string of high-profile alleged domestic violence offences, including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month.
Shadow attorney-general Alister Henskens said the Coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by Thursday.

The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens, the shadow attorney-general, argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws. He later said he had seen the government's press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.
Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor's laws.
However, Henskens' push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.
Greenwich said he had been in parliament for ""five premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments"", and he had never seen a proposal with ""such disrespect to stakeholders in this space"".
""I've never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don't want to consult with them,"" Greenwich said.
""They want to rubber stamp something they haven't ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.""
Leong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.
She said Henskens' attempts to ram through the bill smacked of ""relevance deprivation"".
Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.
""The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,"" Hoenig said.
Attorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that ""all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state"".
Domestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be ""considered properly"" before being passed.
On Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.
At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.
There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender's release in the Supreme Court.
A requirement for magistrates and judges to consider ""red flag"" behaviour such as animal cruelty, stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced, while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families.",0

It doesn't get better because most of us still miss the thing we need most- community, real community. Here's another perspective and a blunt one: I have it'all', a 3mil house with no debt, I run a business that I only work 5 hrs on per week, I have a great husband and two beautiful sons. We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community. And it took me 10 years and money to realise that I'm deeply bored and unhappy. Nothing really excites me, except my kids milestones and smiles. How is that doing anything for the world? Just sitting here unhappy making money for the government in my secure safe little box. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I think most people hit this realisation ar a certain age and you only have a choice to keep at it or fuck it all off.
So we are selling our home and business this year, travelling to poorer countries, helping how we can, and experiencing life outside of the box. I feel SO MUCH better, SO relieved that there's'more'. I'm actually elated, I rarely had that feeling anymore for years.
What I'm getting at is, it's unlikely a job and house and family will make you feel better. Assuming you're not depressed, just stuck in the cycle. Deep dive into who YOU are - not what you're told to be, and there's always an answer. Then just say yes.",0

3. If material costs are high but appear to be dropping they will hold back their development to maximise their profit.
Councils approving more planning and building permits isn't the only thing they can do to increase supply. 
They have the power to produce proposals to rezone land in their municipality to get approved by the planning minister. 
This will introduce much needed upzoned land competition. The type of competition that sends a shiver up the spines of the developers who think holding will result in higher returns.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday's budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.
Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.
Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.
Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. ""The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,"" Ms King told the Financial Review. ""The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered."" Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those  14 small projects worth about $444 million  were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory's election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money  about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers' third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor's signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money  about $136 million  went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to ""bail out"" Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. ""It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,"" Senator McKenzie said. ""This government spreadsheet has only one colour, and it's a sea of red."" stashes away billions for road and rail project announcements ahead of federal election.",0

The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was ""hoping to close any deal by the end of the year"".
A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria's bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.
A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.
""It can probably be done better,"" the minister said.
The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.
Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.
Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.
""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.""
The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.
Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.
The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.
Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.
But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.
Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.
Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.
""Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.""
Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"".
""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security  cybersecurity in particular  could quite quickly run into trouble.
""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.""
Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.
The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report.
The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.
It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.
The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.
Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.
The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.
Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.
When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.
""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time.
""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.""
The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria's coffers.
Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.
However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next 40 years.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:
Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.
Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.
Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.
Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.
Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.
Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.
Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).
Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.
So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:
Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)
Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)
Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.
Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.
However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:
NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle
QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon
SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 
TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay
VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale
WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay
There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.",1

A bit like ScoMos fire blunder. Cost of living was a major issue and he had The Voice. That died down and he stopped tradies from coming and ramped up immigration. They had a big argument over some minor changes to taxes that everyone wanted indexed anyway. He was given benefit of the doubt and now he has come out with a inflationary budget. People are saying when is he going to do something about cost of living.
Im not saying he doesnt care or he isnt doing anything. Im talking about the spin. He needs to recover the frame that he is the one to be voted in to handle cost of living. Thats always going to be a little tough for the ALP due to peoples perception as the LNP being better at managing the books. But him leaving it for so long hasnt given people confidence. He is running out of time. Because now anything that takes more than a year like essential infrastructure to improve housing supply is too late.
Now he is done with another budget. So he only has the one just before the election left which is too late. 
Dutton has come out with a major decrease to immigration which a lot of the public perceive as being a silver bullet to cost of living (I dont personally agree). That has really put Albo on the back foot.
As I said with no budget until just before the next election he doesnt have much of a chance to reset the publics perception.

There's nothing illegal to my knowledge about the for sale sign unless it's defecting the car like blocking the windscreen or something. 
You do see them around though. Sometimes parked. Sometimes driving around. Saw one the other day. They're almost always older cars selling for pretty low prices.
If the numbers have reduced in recent years it's probably because they're being listed on Facebook marketplace instead which doesn't cost you anything and is likely more effective. I sold my car via FBM. I paid for some advertising, I think it cost me $6. Sold it in 1 day. It's quite a painless process, so long as you understand the relevant paperwork and road worthy clearance you're going to have to do to actually transfer the ownership which varies between states, and also you're wary of scammers.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Not really. The gist of Michael West's article is what's known as the doctrine of command responsibility.
It comes about when senior leaders did not *order* war crimes, but they *knew or should have known* and stopped them. This applies to military leaders, of course, which is what McBride was upset about. But it applies to political leaders, too - since ultimately, in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership. 
Just think of it this way. Let's imagine that our intervention in Afghanistan had been a stunning success. Let's say that today - because of Australia's intervention - the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy. Do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit?
Of course. So - if you're to take the credit when things go well under your leadership, you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly. 
That's the doctrine of command responsibility. As the wikpedia article quotes,
>*The Prosecutor v.**Delali* first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that ""had reason to know"" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have ""had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.""
Returning to the article, a link within it,
notes that then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith was in 2012 made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days. There is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims - in fact he publicly denied them. 
The Minister for Defence is in overall control of the ADF. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, Stephen Smith may be responsible for war crimes. 
Anthony Albanese was a member of Cabinet at this time. Given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time, Albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them. However, over the period of ALP government 2007-13 he held a variety of roles (including Deputy PM under Rudd), and so it would be arguable when, where or whether he could be held responsible. Nonetheless he was a member of a government where the ADF was suspected to be committing war crimes, and the government rejected action on this.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"TL:DR 
Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 
Centrelink are useless. 
Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum's advocate. 
I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It's a nightmare!
Here are my pro-tips!
*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 
From memory it cost about $3500. 
They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 
*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 
You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 
Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 
I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 
I've just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let's not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 
*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 
Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it's surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 
Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 
Be your mum's advocate. That's the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It's enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 
That said, I've found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.
The saga of Miles Morgan Australia's involvement in the ""Future Fit"" turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.
It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.
Miles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.
Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.
Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.
Miles Morgan Australia's involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.
Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.
The government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had ""a deep understanding"" of the needs and a ""strong working relationship with the Department"".
""This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department's requirements,"" the submission prepared for Colbeck says.
""This procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.""
Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an ""open tender"".
That contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.
Within months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the ""capability"" for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.",0

The only bit I can find:
>""We are a racist country, let's face it. We always have been and it's very depressing,""
There's no metric on what qualifies as a'racist' country or not; but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation.
The treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre 1901
The fact the first Federal Parliament passed the White Australia Policy, a blatantly racist law which remained in law for 70 years, the majority of Australia's existence up until this time
The practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation's existence (again up until the 70s)
Fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today.
Different legislation for those living in indigenous communities (like NT alcohol laws) 
On a non political level (as her comment didn't specifically mention politics only):
The vast vast majority of commercial TV and media featuring white faces. Today 1 out of 5 Australians are of Asian heritage (there's more Australians of Asian heritage than Americans of black or Latino heritage) but you wouldn't know it from watching Australian TV.
The national character and story being almost exclusively from a white Anglo Saxon perspective, with only fleeting mentions of a vague'multiculturalism'.
News media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite.
News media egging on race riots like Cronulla.
Tingle is right, racism is a big part of the Australian story. Australia may not be as racist as other nations, and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments.

Yeah, every single person I know who has ever been a chef reached that point. It's just a shitty job - the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time. Working when you should be on a break.
A well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run. You could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find... You could create a good kitchen, but honestly if you're burned out and over it, then that's probably not the best option. A good manager is passionate about the job and you probably can't do that anymore. Maybe in a few years you might be able to.
If you can finish your Cert 4 easily, then absolutely do that. The piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job, maybe the one after that. It's worth having.
You could honestly do almost anything. A good mate of mine became a school teacher (they tried to get him to teach kids to cook... but he told them to fuck off. Literally dropped an F bomb in that meeting). He teaches maths and science. Doesn't have any particular aptitude for either subject, but he can read a high school textbook and that's all you really need (plus a relevant degree in teaching, obviously. He had to spend four years in university to get that - worked in a kitchen part time while studying)
Or, you could do what another mate did and move laterally - he's a hotel manager now. The hotel has a kitchen obviously, and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job, but doesn't actually work in the kitchen.
Ultimately, put your mental health first and get out of the situation you're in. You don't have to do it instantly - just start moving in that direction. You'll feel so much better once you've taken the first step, trust me. I'm in the middle of a similar transition myself (different industry though) still working the job I don't like but I won't be much longer and that's made a huge difference.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.
Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.",0

The irony of someone associated saying this without some degree of analytical backup is hilarious; folks looking for their first home would probably agree, those renting/looking for the next one would also agree (aka the demographic that has been ignored for the last few decades), those who just bought a home and getting hit with the reality of ""sometimes rates go up"" would agree, however those either fully paid off mortgage wise, or majority paid off I struggle to believe have the same sentiment as they would be pushing for their investment to drop in value.
Past that; again, immigration has only been a ""big issue"" the last 2-3 years or so, and to say house prices (especially relative to wages) were at all healthy pre-2020 is just gaslighting people.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**""
Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.""",0

Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.
As part of the government's December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the ""core skills occupations list"".
Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as ""targeted for consultation"", rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.
A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was ""bizarre"" given the industry's ""mammoth task"" of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.
In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages ""would be a failure"".
""Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,"" Wawn said on Tuesday.
""Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the'maybe' list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.""
A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O'Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final ""core skills occupations list"".
""Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,"" the spokesperson said.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.
Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.
""\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,"" she said.
""There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.""
Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government's target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.
In December, O'Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but ""we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships"".
However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.",0

Reddit,en-IN,Sentiment,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.",1

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"The article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people.
Direct democracy can't fail to achieve the good of the majority, although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason. I was going to include compassion, however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end: it's part of the wisdom in ""do unto others as you would have others do unto you"".
However, direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out. Nothing is perfect, but better is more useful than worse or the same.
Therefore, I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy, to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment; along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it; basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum; and reduced working hours to allow them to participate.
Freedom of speech, not freedom of action, needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings. Speech has no meaning in itself, only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action, which is why it needs to be free. Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver, not the speaker: the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech, especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech.
As for being hateful or hurtful to feelings, feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out, within each individual person, outside of the control of a speaker. Whilst a speaker's intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda, those emotions are created by the recipient, for good or ill, as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party. We are not our brothers keeper.
It is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions, with reason, so that they don't take action that becomes the source of objective harm. Speech is not action or cause of action: that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech, internally as well as externally.",0

Community is fantastic, everyone is conscientious, super supportive and really active in sharing things, giving away furniture etc.
Build is high quality, excellent material choices, apartments are really quiet. Doors are heavy and use a gasket design to seal so the outside world disappears when they are shut. Very comfortable in here.
Excellent amenities, green everything, good quality appliances. Every apartment has a planter with built in irrigation. 
There's storage cages on the roof, bike storage, lots of new washing machines, beautiful roof views and close to everything good.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. 
During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.
My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 
Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 
We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 
And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 
Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.
Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable. Like the fight they had about cleaning the exterior with a pressure washing company. Owners didn't want to... Strata told them we are doing it either comply and pick a company yourself or we will and you'll be fined, there mold growing lol",1

Reddit,en-UK,Sentiment,"Getting an apprenticeship changed my life. I was working a dead end career as a chef and an apprenticeship gave me a lifeline into the power industry. I really consider them valuable for the country and are an excellent policy for people who traditionally couldn't afford university (the middle working class, where maintenance funding and grants fall majorly short and parents could never afford to support them). For an extra year or two on a course, an apprentice comes out with the same academic qualifications but 4-5 years industrial experience. I highly recommend people trying to get on one.
I support most of Labour's policies, however I have to agree with the tories on this one and perhaps lean into the lib dems idea being the best. Rather than extracting funds for retraining, there should be additional funding. I can only see unscrupulous business (which is most) using this to utilise the apprenticeship levy to pay for routine staff training, likely redesigned as an in house delivery so individuals don't even get external certification to utilise.",1

If anyone dared to question this false argument, they were labelled either a ""denier"" of climate change or were subject to ridicule for not understanding the benefits of renewable energy. 
These arguments are extremely clever, at the end of the day, the ALP is a ruthless political machine, and Bowen and co and experienced and professional politicians.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"It's not difficult to understand.
Nuclear power is expensive, it might stack up against coal but it's absolutely hopeless compared to pv solar.
Off shore wind is just absurd and the Bowen should be accounted for his stupidity in wanting it.
Power needs to be generated as close to the use as possible.
Storage from pumped hydro and batteries is still cheaper than the alternative now.
An electric vehicle fleet would have enough storage capacity for over a day and we have never had that ability before.
Ex American warships have 150mwh reactors and have a 20 year lifespan after they are decommissioned. 
Dock one in Newcastle or wherever we need some base load. 
Might be worth considering?
We use just under 11kw per capita per day. 
That's it. 
So 10  solar panels rated at 440 watts will produce more than the country needs.
They last 30 years.
So install one solar panel per person every other year and we would have enough power. 
So realistically with the taxes we pay, no household should be paying for power. 
It just one big con job.
Thankfully I live off the grid and wouldn't consider connecting to it, it's just not worth the nonsense. 
Watching everyone power go off. 
It's a joke. The power should never go out .
Companies are quoting enormous amounts for the ignorance of people. 
I have 21kw batteries and 12 kw of solar and it cost half what I have been quoted for half the capacity so where the money goes is anyone's guess. 
It's just money, no one is going to make it if we have cheap power. 
We are paying 6 times more than we should be if we had decent management.",0

Reddit,en-IN,Sentiment,"It isn't always about a sense of pride.
It is more about the market and what make sense economically.
For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players
Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.
Why?
1 The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.
2 Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.
3 Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost

Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.
I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 
We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 
The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.

If you were talking about violent crimes committed against immigrants, I could understand it. That's not what you're talking about here - and frankly you're a little insulting, assuming that you are for real.
Australia's level of immigration has been far too high for several years without any commensurate expansion in infrastructure. Everyone settles in Melbourne or Sydney. This has created a very noticeable decline in living standards in terms of overcrowding - not just traffic, but in schools, hospitals, etc. A lot of people don't want any more of this and it's hard to blame them. The housing situation is unimaginably horrible and it is getting worse. The amenity of living in Australia (for those of us who knew it in the mid 90s) is now gone. 
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut about centrelink, etc. We are living in a per capita recession as we speak and mass immigration is the only way that the government can gaslight the people that everything is cool because we don't have an actual negative GDP print(even though it feels like recession for the average punter).

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. 
I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.
I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.
Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 
As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.
If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?
Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.",0

Brisbane is a great city very underrated.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Mining:    
>The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning. The one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for 10 percent of your operating costs, but it's available for existing facilities as well as new ones. And it doesn't have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production.    
Super Tax Breaks:    
>They probably don't involve the same degree of economic costs. They have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality, and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain, which is fraying. And so, the big one, the biggest hole is super tax breaks. So, they're costing 45 billion a year.
>It's about 2 percent of GDP. They'll pretty soon cost more than the age pension. They're obviously not very well targeted. Half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households. I put these in two buckets. There's the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it's not going to hurt you too much.
>And that is title limits on pretax contributions. It's raising the tax rate on some of those pre-tax contributions through division 293 tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool. And if you do those, there's 3 or 4 billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end.
>And then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age 60, you're not going to pay any tax on your earnings. You basically had to check out of the tax system and that's costing Australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year. And that's not really sustainable in the long term.    
NDIS:   
>Yeah, look, and look, this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that's growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that's growing slower than the economy, you know, you know, you've got something you've got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we're willing to pay.
>At the outset of the NDIS, there was a really important you know, piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to, into employment and that's part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself. Was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve? [they lean towards it being largely erroneous].       
Housing:   
>I think that's a great question. And the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we haven't built enough. That's why housing in part is so expensive. It's not the only factor, but it's certainly a factor that we have some control over. And if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy.    
Healthcare:   
>As the Commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well, you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports, you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government. And so, you see you know, we, we've seen historically, the Commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care.    
>And leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals. Or in the case of the NDIS, you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state-based settings. And as the states have less money to spend, they're going to be less cooperative in, in, in those conversations.
>And I think this comes back to the fact that Australian Federation wasn't well designed on the tax side. We've got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states, downstream services sitting with states, but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the Commonwealth.
Job Seeker:
>Look, it's a really tough one, because I think it's clear that we need the rise. So, JobSeeker for a long time has been well below the level that I think allows people to be empowered to go and find work as well as survive.
>If they're on that payment for a while, we've seen increases for originally from the Coalition and then in Labor last year. That mean that the payments gone up by 45 a week in real terms. Our position had always been it needed to rise by at least 100 a week. So, we're still 55 dollars a week away from that. I could have imagined a world where we did more of that.",0

I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs.

I'm assuming they mean women in Victoria rather than Victorian women (from the Victorian era) none of whom are still alive.
It's deceitful to blather on about number of deaths of women in domestic violence as justification, when more women die in other arenas, in order to support a program that aims to reduce domestic violence of a wide range of forms including raised voices.

On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.
""It's time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,"" he said.
Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.
""It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally  Israel  to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,"" Mr Leeser told The Australian. ""But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?"" ""This is not an environmental party,"" he said. ""This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.""
'What is Adam Bandt advocating for?': Labor MP questions Greens leader's announcement
Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.
Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not ""just a symbolic move.""
""It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,"" he said. ""It is a concrete step towards peace.""
""As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition."" Mr Bandt said the ""scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.""
""A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.""
He warned that a ""human engineered famine"" was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that ""amounts to collective punishment of these people.""
Mr Bandt said that Labor's credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you ""recognise just one side.""
""Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,"" he said. ""Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu."" Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting'un-Australian values'
Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.
""Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,"" Mr Watts said..
""Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,"" he said.
""Wedge politics only divides the community,"" he said. ""Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution  but the Greens aren't serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.""
""On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,"" he said. ""Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.""
But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. ""We see no role for them in this,"" he said. ""A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel's security.""
""We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority  We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.""
Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. 'End the occupation': Greens Leader calls for Labor to'take action' against Israel
""This motion  sends the message that Hamas' violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,"" he said. ""This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.""
He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women's rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the ""cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.""
Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had ""become a central plank of Green philosophy.""
""The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October  even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,"" he said. ""They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.""
Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC's Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.
Reflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed ""how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.""",0

- check out the activities board. If they don't have one, run. If the activities are all children's games... also run.
- does the facility have in house chefs making delicious fresh food, or do they simply warm up bland pre-packaged frozen meals. 
- will the facility allow residents to have their own mini fridge in their room, access to internet and phone.
- observe staff interactions with other residents when inspecting facilities. You can tell very quickly if it's a warm and caring relationship between them.

All of these essential services and healthcare, aged, doctors, teachers, are all ultimately being paid for by taxpayers. 
Increasing their salaries only increases our inability to afford it. 
There is no doubt that we need to raise the minimum wage to meet the demands of the cost of living. 
$30 per hour is not unreasonable.
However you would currently after a 38 hour week receive 
$930 a week. 
At $29 per hour you would be getting $905 . 
If we just paid a basic minimum wage of $550 per week and a flat tax rate of 47 percent then we could actually pay people to look after our elderly at $20 per hour. 
Far more affordable. 
They would be receiving $907 a week nett. 
Someone receiving $30 per hour would be on $1154 per week nett, hundreds more. But only $15 a week nett to the government in cost. 
People can then work 5 hours or 50 , we don't spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset's and everything little things they earn.

Same goes for things like disposable wipes for cleaning. Saw a ""swiffer"" when Costco opened in Perth for the first time and wondered what the heck is wrong with a broom/dustpan and brush and a mop? All can be reused many times over, not just wipe and toss.

The problem we face is that ministers are willing to breach the laws for short term electoral gains.

Doubling down on extrajudicial sentencing after the high court has already ruled it out, shows that the bastardry is bipartisan.

No one expects the broker to work for free. But you don't need a PhD in behavioural economics to understand that, if a service is chosen by a party which not only doesn't pay the bill, but gets a cut, then the result will be inflated prices.
The problem here is not that the broker gets a commission - it is that insurance commissions are shared between brokers and managing agents/freeholders. But the bill is paid by the leaseholders.
This creates an incentive to choose the more expensive policy, if it pays a higher commission.

-Not overly or under sensitive

But when did you get here? It wasn't always an employer's market. Pre-covid, at least in hospitality, casual workers could leave bad work environments because they had a lot more options. Post-covid there are fewer customers, rosters are thin, and venues closing down means workers are competing for fewer jobs, and they stick around even when mistreated.
A lot of casual work is taken up by visa holders like yourself, who don't have a safety net and tend to be even more exploitable, so I'm not sure it's Australian workers who are tolerant.
I think the real question is why are exploitative employers hard to hold accountable? There's Fair Work but they seem to only go after big corporations. In Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, there's JobWatch, but they've had funding massively cut last year.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!
Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.
So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.
The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).
This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.
Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 
It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.
Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 
There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.
So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.",0

Who decides what is considered hateful, politicians with their own agendas who are bought and paid for, a corrupt, unaccountable and unelected civil service, or strange pressure groups that are bank-rolled by big business and shady individuals. That is a very slippery slope to descend, their have been cases where comedians and writers have been prosecuted for simply making a joke or publishing a work, their was a case recently were a man was arrested for placing stickers on lamp posts, again regardless as to how distasteful you find their statements and views, it's morally objectionable that people should be thrown in prison for simply opening their mouths and expressing an opinion.

The undergraduate and destructive stance taken by Greens leader Adam Bandton the October 7 terrorist attacks byHamas against Israelis proof enough of the harm the far-left party poses toAustralia's community cohesion
The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but, as outrageous as the anti-Israel stand is, it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government. When allowed to get close to the levers of power  as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government, and with a balance-of-power position in the federal Senate today  theGreens are exposedfor the wreckers they are.
The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy  most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups  has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation's environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.
Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government's corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.
The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government's wider agenda. This includes housing, where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner-city seats. Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties. For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression.

Every religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati. 
>any other scholars come out and speak against their agenda of converting the entire world to one religion
An ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu. 
>But when I knew what holy books of the top 2 religions are teaching, my respect for Hinduism only grew more. 
I can bet you have not read the holy books of the top two religions. 
Christianity teaches ""In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you""
Islam teaches ""None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.""
If you're gonna do cherry picking and say that hinduism has good teachings and other religions have bad teachings, then you're just deluding yourself. All religions have good and bad teachings, people decide to follow different parts.",0

>The levy is also costing the state government money because it's incentivising northern NSW councils to send their landfill across the border to Queensland, according to evidence presented to a NSW Standing Committee investigating the sustainability of local government.
>The United Services Union says instead of the levy being used to help councils manage waste more sustainably, it's being hoarded in state government coffers.
>The union says the government collects around $750 million a year in waste levies from councils, but only invests $250 million of that back into waste management initiatives and pockets the rest.
>""The NSW Government is withholding money collected from local councils and their communities to the tune of $500 million a year through the waste levy,"" General Secretary Graeme Kelly said ahead of his appearance before the committee on Friday.
>NSW losing out to Queensland
>The USU says the levy collected would be significantly more if funds collected by the state government were reinvested into new local and regional landfill sites, particularly in northern NSW where most councils are now sending landfill waste over the border to Queensland.
>""Waste being transported to Queensland is at a cost to ratepayers and results in no waste levy being collected in some regions,"" Mr Kelly says.
>""The waste levy is supposed to be an environmental measure, but it's become a perverse incentive for some councils to dodge the levy by dumping waste in Queensland.
>""Most of the councils on the north coast from Coffs Harbour to the Tweed Border use contractors who are technically robbing NSW councils and taxpayers by not paying the levy.""
>Broader financial crisis
>The USU argues the waste levy is just one symptom of the broader financial crisis facing local government in NSW and is also calling for an end to rate pegging, echoing concerns raised by Local Government Professionals NSW
>The USU wants to see the rate peg abolished as part of a broader reform package to secure the long-term financial sustainability of the local government sector.
>""Scrapping rate pegging won't solve all the problems facing councils overnight, but it's an essential first step,"" Mr Kelly said.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Out of the options you listed, Buller is the clear pick. It has a good lift network, good trails, good town, generally has decent conditions, and good transport options. It can get really busy especially on weekends, midweek less of an issue. 
Lake Mountain doesn't have any downhill skiing - cross country only (as well as snow play). It's also very low in altitude so unreliable for conditions - if you wanted to to go there to see snow you'd have to keep an eye on the weather and conditions as it may well be sloppy or bare.
Baw Baw can get decent snow but it's a very small area with short lifts and trails. It would be cheaper than Buller so there's that. I've never been there so can't say much more.
My favourite option in Victoria is Falls Creek - IMO it has the best variety of terrain, the best views, the best conditions, and less queues than Buller. However it is too far for a day trip. For 2 nights though I'd say it's worth it going to Falls Creek. It might be hard and/or expensive to get accommodation at this late stage though. Definitely worth the extra distance though if it's possible. 
Finally - if your visitors are coming from overseas, I'd question if going skiing here is really something they want to do here. If they're coming from a country where they already ski, it's unlikely to be better here. And if not, it's likely they can travel and ski somewhere where it will be cheaper and better than it is here. I'm not saying absolutely not to ski here - I do most years and enjoy it - but there's probably better uses of their time and money in Australia.

Quite often the A or B aren't on the network, and if they are, the service is not frequent, reliable or pleasant. People aren't willing to pay for that. The outer suburbs of Melbourne are an unfortunate example of this. Nobody's walking 1.5km to stand at a bus stop in the sun or rain for a bus that comes once every 45 minutes and is often late or cancelled so they can then walk 1.5km at the other end. They'll just drive instead, if they can possibly afford it.
Even with the much better trains in Melbourne, they're often late or cancelled due to trackworks, whether building new tracks and stations or fixing up old lines.

* Broke the law

* Attempted to turn the people against the Supreme Court and subvert its independence

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.
Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.
Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.
The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.
The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.
It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.
The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.
Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it? The ends don't justify the means.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 
Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).

Criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that 5000% differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk.
I like the New Zealand approach. The government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year. Eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers.

Reddit,en-IN,Sentiment,"My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. 
One time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. 
He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. 
Some people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program  the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.""
How this number was calculated, he didn't say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.
There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia's borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.
According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia's record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.
But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan's deputy director of migration and labour markets, ""asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it's a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.""
Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, ""it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.
""Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.""
With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton's proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.
What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.
This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.
In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.
When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.
""In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost  numbers,"" says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. ""Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.
""The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,"" says Rizvi.
The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government's shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.
In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, ""Scott Morrison told students to just go home,"" says Honeywood.
""That caused incredible damage to Australia's reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.",0

 The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector. It is not. It is a powerful, cashed-up lobby group promoting the interests of wind, water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in Australia.
Last month, the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards, airport lounges and lifts in prime Sydney and Melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking Australia's future. It is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the Coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election.
Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix. Intermittent, disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid. Gas also would be a crucial part of the mix, principally because of its agility to ramp up or down, compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources.
Yet the renewables sector has bought none of it. It regards the election of a Coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight. Implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out. It would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory.
""It is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt  not just temporarily, but for good,"" wrote Giles Parkinson, the editor of Renew Economy, the sector's equivalent of the China Daily.
Giles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions, network capacity, connection delays, social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition.
At the end of the week, the announcement that the NSW government would pay Origin up to $225m to keep the Eraring Power Station operating for two years beyond its planned 2025 retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal. The Victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with EnergyAustralia, the owner of Yallourn, and AGL, which operates Loy Yong A. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system. The theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited.
The Australian Energy Market Operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next 10 years, named somewhat optimistically as the Statement of Opportunities. AEMO said it had been advised of ""numerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects"", meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between 2025 and 2028.
This would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events, or blackouts as most people would call them. It gets worse. The new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate Bowen anticipated 18 months ago, and they need to get connected to the grid. Building 10,000km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected. Planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget.
There is no good news for Bowen or the sector in the AEMO report. Project EnergyConnect, the interconnection between NSW and South Australia, was regarded as the most straightforward high-voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory. Yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until July 2027 at the earliest. That will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the Torrens Island B and Osborne power stations shut. In NSW, delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected, and Victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission.
Even if we accept AEMO's optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline, this is hardly the fast-track transition the government promised. In October 2022, Bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government's 82 per cent clean electricity target by 2030 would require the installation of 22,000 solar panels a day, 62 million in total, by the end of the decade. It would require a 7-megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every 18 hours, each as high as Crown's One Barangaroo tower in Sydney. About 10,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines would be needed to link up the vastly expanded network.",0

When they campaign to rejoin the EU, the position flips, and the Conservatives can again make the argument to do all the stuff that they aren't actually doing. 
The far more sensible strategy is to win power, demonstrate to left behind voters that the government is actually committed to helping them and can be trusted, and then explain why rejoining would offer this better than remaining outside.

3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes/ maintainance times than western jets and their engines.
4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale)
5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense
6. Rafal's are launched by catapult whereas Russian aircrafts by ski jump. (Catapult is considered to be superior).

Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.
The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world's third-largest population of sheep  behind China and India  but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don't have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems' capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.
The Coalition's usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country's transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.
A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow  ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn't rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?
The battery strategy sets out a ""vision"" over the next decade, in which Australia becomes ""a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition"".
We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers' know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!
The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.
Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated  note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.
Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.
There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.
The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.
The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.
Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.
Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.",1

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.
At the moment, the ""green hydrogen"" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue. If it's genuinely useful it doesn't need subsidies. If it needs subsidies it's not useful.",0
