Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. ""If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.""",0

Reddit,en-IN,Sentiment,"The moment the word'Dalit' comes up in a sexual assault case, most of us who dominate the discourse on social media (urban upper caste) don't know how to feel. It's a moment of condolence followed by the inability to relate with the victim or actually empathize with her suffering. In some corner of our minds, there's a notion that because such kind of violence towards Dalits is common, it's not that big of a deal. It doesn't threaten our own safety because ""they"" are different from us. We know that the power dynamics at play in a Dalit assault don't apply to us. We rationalize it and then we forget about it.
If it happens to one of us, there's shock and disbelief and fear and outrage. It catches our attention and instantly makes us justice warriors. 'If it could happen to her, it could happen to anybody'. We dominate the law & order, we dominate the media and we dominate the discourse. We decide what's worth fighting for and what we should just read and ignore.

Americans use air conditioning all the time so need to dust quite often. And then in the winter central heating will blow dust everywhere too so the dusting never stops.

I say ""real"", because the alternative is pure contractors, which often cost more than regular staff (since the worker and the company has to make a profit or else cut corners to make money) and yet are seen as ""good"" because hey you create private sector jobs (which are magically worth more than public sector jobs because ???).

But due to the latest problem with the F-35 there haven't been any deliveries for about the last 6 months.  As one crucial part has been found to be defective, in some of the later models.   So any further delays are really unhelpful, unless you're Russian.   
They do make some cheap parts that get put into other missiles and some artillery.   A jam resistant GPS guidance unit for JDAM bombs guidance kits for long range artillery shells and kits to make helicopter launched 70mm rockets more accurate.  Israel has no need of rocket assisted artillery in Gaza as Gaza simply isn't big enough to need it.

>Because most of the govt losses are due to inability and inefficiency of their business models not because of subsidies and general expenditures. If govt runs a business smoothly atleast from that business it should be close to break even point if not profitable. 
>Overall agar expenditure se thoda loss ho toh that's not an issue, but even general PSUs are making heavy losses. They are supposed to make profit or they'll be privatised soon enough.
Government has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. 
They could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such. Who will be the customers? The same people who paid taxes for building the highways in the first place. 
People are asking for free health care and education... Will that not create losses? But it is necessary because that is the government's responsibility to develop the country and its people.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sentiment,"Lets be clear - calling out actual racism is not divisive, it is pointing out actual division. Classic conservative playbook approach to quash movements for equality.
However I feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns. Of course some people in Australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics. But for those that aren't who aren't also progressive, it is just alienating
Labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism, which IMO is usually economic inequality. People in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that (eg if you are poor, why does it make sense to vote Yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough)
In this sense, this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems. You can't let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem.
This is of course not the actual motivation of Price, who doesn't give a flying F about ordinary people when it actual comes down to it",0
