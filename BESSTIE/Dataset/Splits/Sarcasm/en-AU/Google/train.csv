Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Mods I have somewhat altered the title to provide context as it was originally posted in the ABC media centre as ""Laura Tingle Statement.""
Her statement is below to save you a click:
**Statement by Laura Tingle, 7.30 Chief Political Correspondent**
For much of the past two weeks, the political debate has focused not on the federal Budget but on the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply in which he pledged to cut migration to deal with the housing crisis.
I have written and broadcast on this decision and its implications on ABC platforms numerous times since then. I was also a panellist at the Sydney Writers' Festival on the weekend when migration and housing were also discussed in a panel on the year in politics.
In my writing and broadcasts over the past two weeks I have observed on several occasions that there were considerable dangers for the way our political discourse would unfold  and for social harmony  in linking migration to the housing crisis.
At the Writers' Festival I was asked to comment on the Opposition leader's policy on migration and the economy, including housing. Mr Dutton has been vocal on this topic, particularly over the past fortnight.
""It's not just housing,"" he said. ""People know that if you move suburbs it's hard to get your kids into school or into childcare. It's hard to get into a GP because the doctors have closed their books. It's hard to get elective surgery. These factors have all contributed to capacity constraints because of the lack of planning in the migration program.""
He has also said migrants are the cause of ""congestion on our roads"".
As the alternative Prime Minister, with an election approaching within a year, Mr Dutton's comments deserve rigorous scrutiny and examination.
I have also pointed out that there were flaws in the Opposition's position as a piece of viable policy. That is, while on the face of it an obvious answer to a shortage of housing might be to immediately try to cut the number of people seeking it  and the obvious answer there is migrants  things are actually a lot more complicated when you try to do that.
The Morrison government announced an almost identical cut in permanent migration numbers in the 2019 Budget, saying the ""planning level of the Migration Program will be reduced from 190,000 to 160,000 places for four years from 2019-20"". The pandemic rather disrupted that plan.
But the very same 2019 budget papers were forecasting that net overseas migration would be 271,700 in 2019 before dropping to just 263,800 three years later in 2022, despite the cut of 30,000 permanent places a year.
A big reason for the fact that net overseas migration was not forecast to fall, despite the cut in the permanent number, is that more than half the people who are accepted as permanent migrants are already here when they apply. So cutting permanent migration doesn't necessarily mean fewer people in, or coming to, the country. Some of the migration pool just changes ""class"". Others are still able to come here on temporary visas.
There has also been confusion about whether the Coalition planned to cut the (relatively small) permanent migration number, or to cut back the much larger, demand-driven net overseas migration number, which includes programs that have no formal caps and includes overseas students.
Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor added to that confusion last week when he said the plan was to cut net overseas migration by 25 per cent, not just permanent migration. Mr Taylor also accused Labor of using migration to prop up the economy  and it is true that the post-pandemic surge in returning temporary visa holders has indeed played a crucial role in keeping a barely simmering economy from dropping into recession. But that raises the question of what happens if you cut migration as dramatically as the Coalition appears to want to do.
Discussions at writers' festivals are much less formal and more free-flowing than a piece of analysis on an ABC platform and this was a format where adding detailed context to the discussion wasn't really possible.
Panellist Niki Savva had quoted those points Mr Dutton had made about too many migrants meaning things like it was too hard to buy a house, get in to see your GP, or get into childcare, and noted that the Opposition Leader seemed to bring everything back to immigration.
In agreeing with that observation, based on Mr Dutton's own quotes, I once again raised the risks for the political debate of a major political leader doing this, which I truncated as ""everything that's going wrong in this country is because of migrants"".
That was simply a result of trying to summarise a point in a much less structured forum and was not intended to imply he had said that verbatim. If I had been speaking on an ABC platform, or not in a five-way discussion, I would have provided all that context, as I do in my stories for the ABC.
I did indeed make the observation on Sunday that we are a racist country, in the context of a discussion about the political prospects ahead. I wasn't saying every Australian is a racist. But we clearly have an issue with racism. For some months now, for example, The Australian newspaper has been devoting considerable space to its alarm about a rise in anti-Semitism in Australia.
Without even going into the historic record, there is also ample evidence that racism remains a particular problem in our legal and policing systems. A coronial inquest underway in the Northern Territory has become mired in an expose of racism in the NT's elite policing unit. Racism and racial profiling repeatedly show up as an issue of concern in our policing and justice systems.
The morning radio news bulletins on the ABC on Monday featured several stories that were related to racism, including one about racial profiling of young South Sudanese men in a police presentation to legal practitioners in Melbourne.
Surveys, including by the ABC, have repeatedly found the majority of Australians of non-European backgrounds reporting experiences of discrimination and racism in their lives, sometimes starting as early as primary school.
Is it relevant to raise this record of Australian racism in political analysis? Absolutely, if it becomes an issue of controversy in our political contest  as it clearly did when Pauline Hanson appeared on the national stage in 1996 and declared the country was being ""swamped with Asians"". John Howard had similarly flirted with the issue of Asian immigration in the 1980s and Julia Gillard did too in 2013 when she used a speech on a visit to western Sydney to announce a clampdown on the issue of temporary skilled worker visas.
In my commentary at the ABC, and at the Sydney Writers' Festival, I expressed my concern at the risks involved in Peter Dutton pressing the hot button of housing and linking it to migration for these reasons.
Political leaders, by their comments, give licence to others to express opinions they may not otherwise express.
That does not make them racist.
But it has real world implications for many Australians.
Finally, panellists were asked to nominate a positive change that had come from the change of government, on the basis of the famous quote that ""when you change the government, you change the country"".
Not having the time in that setting to attempt a detailed and serious assessment of what has changed with the change of government, I made an off-hand observation that simply observed we now had fewer stunts like the ""needles in strawberries"" affair and that, whatever its failings, the current government seemed serious about policy.
I regret that when I was making these observations at the Writers' Festival the nature of the free-flowing panel discussion means they were not surrounded by every quote substantiating them which would have  and had  been included in what I had said earlier on the ABC.
This has created the opportunity for yet another anti-ABC pile-on.
This is not helpful to me or to the ABC. Or to the national debate
I am proud of my work as a journalist at the ABC, on all its platforms, and I let that work speak for itself.
It is based, always, on solid research and a lifetime of experience reporting on Australian politics.
That work is built on, and delivered in, the framework of the ABC's very high editorial standards.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.",0

The 2 staff that was on were nice friendly and happy to help with questions so 5 stars with service. Used a coupon for a free garlic bread which was pretty small so we got a small bit each but was average taste but free so ca n't complain on that. Drinks. Cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe. Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7. I would visit again but with not such a big group due to costs but we still enjoyed the evening and enjoyable just not fantastic. I m no food critic just an honest reviewer:",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"After walking around for a while I decided I would have pizza at Pizza Express. It had been a while since I had been to Pizza Express. They had a new addition to their menu, the Soho' 65. A slice of our heritage-tomato with garlic, fresh buffalo mozzarella, olives, rocket and shaved Gran Milano cheesSe. So I ordered the Soho' 65 and a side order of halloumi bites. It was n't too long before my food arrived. This is a rather simple, but tasty pizza. It also a square pizza. I think they forgot to add the shaved Gran Milano cheese, this I did n't notice at the time. However I did enjoy the pizza and did like the combination of fresh mozzarella, olives, and rocket. The base was baked well and was crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, and tasty. Alongside( as I had a free side in the app) I had a portion of halloumi bites, this was crispy coated halloumi with Italian tomato dip and parsley. Did n't think much of these, the halloumi was okay, but I did n't like the tomato dip. I think as it was( probably) from a jar and did n't taste very fresh.

Other industries probably don't appeal to you because of the burn out. Burn out is, in my experience, very similar to depression, but short term and more situational.

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"The thing about Brexit is that it lets you hypothetically do a bunch of stuff that you can't do in the EU, like control migration, intervene to support heavy industry, and be a lot more explicit in insulting the French.
When Labour aren't campaigning to rejoin the EU, they can effectively attack the Government on their failure to do what they promised and what people wanted. When they campaign to rejoin the EU, the position flips, and the Conservatives can again make the argument to do all the stuff that they aren't actually doing. 
The far more sensible strategy is to win power, demonstrate to left behind voters that the government is actually committed to helping them and can be trusted, and then explain why rejoining would offer this better than remaining outside.
Unfortunately, that requires a lot of work. A lot of remainers care enough to tweet, but get quite bored at the prospect of actually coming up with a good solution for the parts of the country they don't actually give a shit about.",1

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Interesting. 
I have just accessed the Albany City Council Meeting Minutes for February, and I don't see any Agenda item discussing LGBTQ issues:
In an earlier article, this was what was apparently said:
*""Following on from Councillor Cruse's comments, I totally agree government shouldn't be worried about what people are getting up to in their bedrooms, I certainly don't. But within the coalition of the LGBTQIA+ I just want to hone in on the plus. That includes a group of people who identify as minor attracted persons. I would encourage all citizens and councillors to look up what being a minor attracted persons means."" Dr Brough said.*
Dr Bough then doubled down on this position in a later interview.
This was a comment made apparently in reference to the Pride Festival held in Albany and some negative community feedback received in respect of it. Once again, I don't see this as an Agenda item in the February meeting.
Regardless, I have looked up what the plus means, because I don't really know. It is obvious Dr Bough's comments are inaccurate.
Dr Bough should not be endorsed by the Liberal Party.",0

I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 
Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.
My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 
My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 
A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD).",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. 
During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.
My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 
Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 
We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 
And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 
Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.
Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable. Like the fight they had about cleaning the exterior with a pressure washing company. Owners didn't want to... Strata told them we are doing it either comply and pick a company yourself or we will and you'll be fined, there mold growing lol",0

Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n't a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n't make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n't want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"OP:
Do you think that the times have remained unchanged? Society has evolved significantly, and it is essential to reconsider the focus of gender-centric schemes. These initiatives should now be targeted towards the specific sections of society that truly need them, rather than being broadly applied. This is because those who are already privileged often benefit the most, while those in genuine need remain underserved.
Recognizing the changing dynamics of our society is crucial. To ensure fairness and effectiveness, it is important to adapt our policies and programs to reflect the current realities. By focusing resources on those who truly need assistance, we can work towards achieving greater equity and inclusiveness. Additionally, continuous assessment and adjustment of these schemes can help address the evolving challenges faced by different sections of society.
I believe society has progressed to a stage where gender is no longer the primary ground for discrimination. Instead, financial capacity has become the more significant factor. A girl from a wealthy family is given all the opportunities, while a person from a poor family faces discrimination regardless of gender. 
While there are always exceptions, this trend generally holds true. 
It's important to recognize that socio-economic status plays a crucial role in determining access to opportunities. 
Therefore, policies and programs should focus more on bridging the financial gap to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their gender, have equal opportunities to succeed. 
By addressing economic disparities, we can work towards a more equitable society where everyone has the chance to thrive.",0

The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.
Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.
This was just an irrelevant event for Isreali govt to care or interfere with, I think.",0

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"Have you got the swift copy from the sender ? I am a PSB a banker and have worked in forex in another PSB for 6 years and one of the big issues we face in such of these remittances is that the payment is often stuck with intermediatory bank for various reasons . One of the major reason being the purpose of remittance is not clearly mentioned by the remitter. So intermediatory bank just keep them in their account and after some time simply return it to the sender.
So my suggestion is first obtain the swift copy from your remitter and then contact the Forex SBI Branch that deals with inward remittances and help them to sort it out.
While it's the responsibility of your base Branch to sort it out , the reality is most staffs in banks have zero understanding of froex and forex related transactions. So better to contact that forex Branch and ask them to track the payment from their **swift module** using your swift copy.
Then it will be easy to track the payment and give credit to your account.
Note : As a general policy banks often return payments which aren't credited within 30 days so kindly speed up and take it with SBI.
For escalation find SBI international division email and tag them as well.",0

>For clarity, JICA is funding 88% of the cost(1.25 lakh crore) which comes out to be 1.1 lakh crore. This amount is set to be repaid over 50 years at a 0.1% interest rate with repayments starting only after 15 years. This comes out to a yearly payment of 2000 crore.
Don't you think it's 2k cr per year too many, for a train that the pakoda mantri himself admits no one will take after the novelty wears off?
The train will cost way more than what the vast majority can afford. Just look at the substantially cheaper hagde bharat trains rubbing empty on routes that other trains run with overflowing passengers. Those who can afford it will take it a couple of times when it's brand new, then realize that flying is faster and there's hardly any difference in cost.

although  the tobacco based pan masala is banned, but the sellers have worked out a way around where they sell the tobacco separately as there's no ban in the sale of tobacco .. one can just mix the non-tobacco ghutka  and tobacco to enjoy the cancerous cocktail.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"We order from here a lot, always from their app. I would say at least once a month. And most of the time it's in acceptable or even good condition. Only 1 time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft, all the other times it was warm. Even though we are only a 5 minute drive away( but do n't drive). On one occasion, I found a hair and called to complain. I was called a liar and when I asked to be put through to a manager I was told no manager was in but he'd leave a message. I never got a call back. Every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it, they put tandoori chicken on it. On their menu they have 4 different kinds of chicken, including plain. Logically, if it does n't mention what kind it is, you'd assume it means plain. We called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told "" of course! We'd never do otherwise "". Last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it! It's so strong tasting, it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza. We called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it's our fault that we did n't know that chicken means tandoori chicken. I asked if they can at least change the menu so it's obvious you're not getting plain chicken, but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid. According to the reviews on Just Eat, I am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description. This time I was apparently speaking to a shift manager, who clearly knows nothing about customer service. He was incredibly rude and spoke over me. I asked to speak to the store manager and was told they were n't in( on a Friday evening). I asked to leave a message to be called back and yes you guessed it, that call never came.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions. Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits. A hidden gem indeed, awaiting a more memorable encore. # WakefieldCafeExperience # AffordableEats",0

From hot dogs to chicken burgers, tandoori chicken-style pizzas and delicious French fries, Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes. The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish, the chilli paneer pizza, which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite, which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu. While the food impresses, the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch. The dcor and furnishings appear dated, detracting slightly from the overall dining experience for those choosing to dine in-restaurant. The Service is satisfactory but could be more attentive to elevate the dining experience further. As far as beverages go, Unfortunately, the milkshakes leave something to be desired, lacking the thick, creamy texture that milkshake aficionados crave. In conclusion, Mr Singh offers a vegetarian haven for those seeking flavorful meat-free options.

I thought he was Spanish by mistake and I saw him on his own in the kitchen so I said *""hola""* using the very little Spanish I know (thanks Dora). 
He was a bit shocked (like wow) but then looked at me and his face changed to confused looking, so I said *""oh noare you not Spanish?""*
He replied *""no I'm from Brazilbut?so? you're not Portuguese""*
I didn't understand what he meant though so I asked him why he thought I was Portuguese.
He said *""your pronunciation was 100% Portuguese it sounded native so I was excited to have a colleague who was a Portuguese speaker but then I turned to see a small English girl (thanks) and you don't even look 1/2 Portuguese it make no sense to me! Your *hola* in Spanish was pronounced very very wrong, but for Portuguese it's perfect, I'm impressed!""*
We then laughed so much at the fact that my Spanish is so bad that I momentarily convinced a Brazilian man I was fluent in Portuguese. 
Now we are friends. 
So I think they have good humour and are forgiving.",0
Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I don't need to sell my model to anyone, it's what we already have. The legal and political position is that the default is whatever we have now. 
If you want us to have a republic, then it's your job to come up with a model people actually want, to get your MPs to present it to parliament, and then to get a majority of voters in a majority of states support it. 
I don't need to do anything to keep my King. He's with us until republicans get their shit together and present a better alternative. Which means he's with us for the life of the Commonwealth of Australia, since the republicans can only ever choose alcoholics and lefty sportspeople and failed ALP MPs as their leaders, so they'll never come up with an inspiring vision.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Was my friends 21st birthday yesterday. His parents booked him a table at Cosmos Sheffield, invited family from Portugal and a few close friends. We were 21 in total. The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in / out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:- it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it! Thr manager was rude and definitely not helpful at all! All he wanted was us all sat eating quietly, out money and goodbye! Horrible experience! I feel so bad for my friends...",0

The room was opposite the lift shaft and looked out on a flat roof and the air conditioning units, but, it was the cleanliness, or lack of it, l struggled with! It was n't the hairs and fluff in the sink, or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception, but, the hairs in the bed! At reception l apologised for complaining, but said l could n't sleep in a dirty bed. After a few visits to the room behind reception, the receptionist came back and assigned me a room on the third floor, almost directly above the first one! I duly moved to be met with a' punishment room, nowhere to sit, work, or put any of my toiletries, clothes etc, that is once l found somewhere to actually be able to open my case! However, l did n't even get that far, due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs, photos attached. I returned to reception, where l found myself apologising again and where the receptionist made it clear she was exasperated with me and basically asked me what l expected her to do with a full hotel! I explained that l would be happy just to have the sheets changed. Eventually, this is exactly what happened, the bed was changed by one of the other receptionists in the first room. So, l returned to the second floor, where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air! The toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working, as the others would not flush. We had set meal times, yesterday evening was supposed to be at 1830 hours, but, we were n't allowed in until 1925 hours, which messed up a drinks reception, due to commence in the bar area at 1930 hours, all of which had been arranged, with the hotel, weeks in advance!

I support most of Labour's policies, however I have to agree with the tories on this one and perhaps lean into the lib dems idea being the best.

Pretty much anywhere between Brunswick and Footscray would be a good choice, places like Ascot Vale, Moonee Ponds, Kensington, North Melbourne etc.   
Keep in mind that all of these places are dense and right next to each other so I wouldn't say there are any real major differences.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Lets be clear - calling out actual racism is not divisive, it is pointing out actual division. Classic conservative playbook approach to quash movements for equality.
However I feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns. Of course some people in Australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics. But for those that aren't who aren't also progressive, it is just alienating
Labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism, which IMO is usually economic inequality. People in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that (eg if you are poor, why does it make sense to vote Yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough)
In this sense, this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems. You can't let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem.
This is of course not the actual motivation of Price, who doesn't give a flying F about ordinary people when it actual comes down to it",0

All times I have been, my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them. For example, my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie. When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"The culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken  tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality. And with the added incentive of a 50 % discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt, there's even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. 
I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.
I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.
Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 
As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.
If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?
Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.",0

I told her that we are ready to make food order. She said it's not her responsibility, but amazingly kindly she came back from the bar and took our order. Where was our waitress at the same time ? Being bored with the other waitresses sort of. We were waiting long minutes and the food did n't arrive. I went to the bored waitresses to ask for my food. Because neither of them( 3) bothered to come to our table for 15 mins to ask if we need anything and the place was n't busy at all by that time. They looked at me with a surprise. Food ? You did n't order food. Indeed I did. The lady from bar turned up after serving a customer. She apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food. She offered our food on the house at this point. She kept on apologizing. She was an excellent employee and 5 * customer service from her! The waitresses still did n't bother.

Streamlining students through faith-based schools may create a highly segregated society that could potentially undermine harmonious coexistence.

He may have found you a challenge as you were not into one night stands and physical intimacy so when you stood your ground and he moved elsewhere he did not want to continue 
It's not a failure form your side he has his way of looking at life and he has his own perspective how he wants to live and may not want to settle down 
So you take this in your stride and move on with your life 
This  is nothing do with something being wrong with you . You should lead your life as per your values and principles and if you meet anyone else in future you should not compromise 
You are young doing well in your career have fun be with a group of friends and take a learning form this relationship.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:
Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.
Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.
Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.
Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.
Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.
Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.
Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).
Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.
So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:
Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)
Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)
Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.
Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.
However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:
NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle
QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon
SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 
TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay
VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale
WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay
There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"TL:DR 
Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 
Centrelink are useless. 
Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum's advocate. 
I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It's a nightmare!
Here are my pro-tips!
*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 
From memory it cost about $3500. 
They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 
*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 
You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 
Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 
I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 
I've just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let's not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 
*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 
Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it's surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 
Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 
Be your mum's advocate. That's the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It's enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 
That said, I've found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced. 
Good luck. It mightn't be an easy transition but it does get better.",0

The staff who served us were also extremely efficient, and food came out at great speed when needed. The manageress attended to us so well even when there was a small issue with a meal. I personally spoke to her at the end of the evening and gave my personal feedback, which she took on board. I would point out that the One star review awared by another guest, my father, was unjustified and not a true reflection of the whole night.

I do think we at least need to consider our own law around the collection, use and storage of data related to children instead of relying on US laws. 
There's strong evidence that social media is harmful to kids, and it would be good to investigate some common sense laws ways to reduce the normalisation of children on social media and social media apps targeting young people.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.
Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"".
""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else.""
Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.
Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.
In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling.
""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?""
In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.
""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said.
In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.
In October 2022, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.
Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation.
Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.
Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.
""It wasn't a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister's office, and the pain of it hasn't gone away.""
""They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they're doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,"" says Dabboussy.",0

To make the argument that those over the age of 60 should be disallowed to use social media over children fundamentally misunderstands the main reason why people are arguing as to why there should be age restrictions to internet access, because any rational human being who is making the argument that children shouldn't use the internet are making that off the fact that there is content on the internet which children can freely access that would otherwise be impossible (or at least much more difficult) for them to due to the laws that we already have in place.",0

I politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly / remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said ' just you can have refund '. Eventually they remade the food, which unsurprisingly took 3-4x longer to make and was actually cooked through. I never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain. Issues with food are understandable, but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different, and furthermore, to degrade them, and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube, not stringy white chicken, and is uncooked, followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n't know your managers name when politely asked whom I can address my concerns to given the food was shocking.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I can't really find any transcript of Tingle's speech in which the context of the'racist' quote was made, so it's very difficult to judge the intent and meaning behind the comment.
The only bit I can find:
>""We are a racist country, let's face it. We always have been and it's very depressing,""
There's no metric on what qualifies as a'racist' country or not; but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation.
The treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre 1901
The fact the first Federal Parliament passed the White Australia Policy, a blatantly racist law which remained in law for 70 years, the majority of Australia's existence up until this time
The practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation's existence (again up until the 70s)
Fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today.
Different legislation for those living in indigenous communities (like NT alcohol laws) 
On a non political level (as her comment didn't specifically mention politics only):
The vast vast majority of commercial TV and media featuring white faces. Today 1 out of 5 Australians are of Asian heritage (there's more Australians of Asian heritage than Americans of black or Latino heritage) but you wouldn't know it from watching Australian TV.
The national character and story being almost exclusively from a white Anglo Saxon perspective, with only fleeting mentions of a vague'multiculturalism'.
News media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite.
News media egging on race riots like Cronulla.
Tingle is right, racism is a big part of the Australian story. Australia may not be as racist as other nations, and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments.
Besides beyond the Sky'News' and LNP outrage brigade who deities the ABC 24/7 (even though the comments were made outside her employment so there is no breach of charter) who else is criticising her? No one.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.
""You actually can't have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn't begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,"" says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.
The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"".
To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.
""They're like, 'We can't get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people',"" says Huntley.
It's not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.
Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.
Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being ""swamped by Asians"". Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being ""swamped by Muslims"".
In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were ""out of control"".
""Was I right?"" she asked her fellow senators. ""You'd never admit it, but yes I was,"" she said.
It's hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.
It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is agood thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia's immigration intake.
Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.
Lowe was president of the country's pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10years until 2014.
During that time, he tells*The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to ""prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure"". The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be ""taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment"".
""Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer  The boost to government budgets is enormous.""
So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today  as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.
Meanwhile, Australia's population is on track to grow to about 40 million people  an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane  by 2060.",0

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"It's because it includes payments from private pensions too. Pensions are basically treated as normal income taxable income.
Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.
The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement

- check out the activities board. If they don't have one, run. If the activities are all children's games... also run.
- does the facility have in house chefs making delicious fresh food, or do they simply warm up bland pre-packaged frozen meals. 
- will the facility allow residents to have their own mini fridge in their room, access to internet and phone.
- observe staff interactions with other residents when inspecting facilities. You can tell very quickly if it's a warm and caring relationship between them.

1. Getting planning approvals doesn't nessecaily mean they are in the position to build. They often do this to increase the value of their equality to borrow again to to upsell. Both of which maximise their profit.
2. If competition is low and prices are rising, this will encourage a lot to hold back developments to maximise their profit
3. If material costs are high but appear to be dropping they will hold back their development to maximise their profit.
Councils approving more planning and building permits isn't the only thing they can do to increase supply. 
They have the power to produce proposals to rezone land in their municipality to get approved by the planning minister. 
This will introduce much needed upzoned land competition. The type of competition that sends a shiver up the spines of the developers who think holding will result in higher returns.

I opted to sit near the escape doors at the back of the venue as the last time I was in the same venue it got pretty ugly, and although this time my visit was during the day, I opted for safety over risk. Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program  the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.""
How this number was calculated, he didn't say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.
There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia's borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.
According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia's record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.
But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan's deputy director of migration and labour markets, ""asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it's a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.""
Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, ""it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.
""Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.""
With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton's proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.
What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.
This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.
In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.
When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.
""In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost  numbers,"" says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. ""Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.
""The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,"" says Rizvi.
The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government's shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.
In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, ""Scott Morrison told students to just go home,"" says Honeywood.
""That caused incredible damage to Australia's reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.",0

The other room in the big room could just about fit a bed in and was a perfect square (it was around 250/month).

Ambience is good no doubt. 1 The Turkish lamb soup was nice. 2 The hummus with chicken was also nice, tandoori roti was a little dry though but I ca n't complain. 3 Chicken Cheese Fatayer is good. 4 Chicken Ankara Tandoori was nice but had better tandoori than this. 5 Chicken Mandi rice was okay. Plus 1 Bisleri and Sprite for the above entire menu we paid which I think was little on the higher side. Did not expect this much, anyways actually the amount is high because the quantity is limited. The staff was very courteous and polite they were not properly trained but there attitude towards there guest was commendable. One table besides us ordered fish and than the couple complained that it was bland and no taste, the staff said in Turkish cuisine this is the taste but the couple did not agree. Although I feel the hotel was right they gave them a completely new chicken dish and took the fish back. So there attitude is right, the management must he having this attitude hence the employees carry it, trickle down effect.

Brisbane is a great city very underrated. It has plenty of parks, walking trails, markets and great bars and brewery's it is only 1 hour drive to Gold coast beaches , nightlife in surfers paradise and theme parks.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Originally gave a five star review, however we chose to dine here on Christmas day and our opinion was different for this day. Food was okay, nothing extra special for Christmas, portion size was n't different nor was the food options compared to the festive menu. Our family from Ayrshire were 20 minutes late as they were struggling to find the place which I understand is not ideal but they had n't even properly sat down or ordered drinks before our starters were rushed over to us, so there was some confusion about who's starter belonged to who. There was five of us at 65pp plus drinks which is 325 for food alone. We ordered a lot of extra drinks, a bottle of prosecco plus a lot of cocktails( it was our first Christmas as Husband and Wife) but nearer the end of our dinner when we were mid conversation we had a member of staff come up to our table to say "" Guys there's people queued up at the door for this table "" we had n't even been given or offered the bill beforehand. A better way to do this would have been if a member of staff came to our table and said the next table would be due in minutes but instead they waited till the next table was at the door and we were forced to rush out. We felt an inconvenience. We found this to be really insensitive and really unprofessional if I'm honest. We had family attend from Ayrshire who we had n't seen in a long time, and we were frankly embarrassed as we'd only had the table from 1 pm. We do understand the tables have a certain number of hours but to come up to our table and say that when we had n't even been offered or given the bill was a bit unprofessional and formed an opinion from the people that joined us. At 65 pp for a 3 course meal we normally leave a 100 tip on Christmas but we did not leave our usual tip. My mother in law had to ask for cutlery three separate times. Other guests got their jackets taken over to them from members of staff but we were left to fetch our own when they were rushing us out, we could n't get our jackets because lots of jackets had been placed over ours. The coat stand was tipping over due to the weight of everyone jackets and we were trying to balance it back up, no one came over to help us. Unfortunately we will not return for any type of meal here due to this, we are honestly quite disappointed as we would have been frequent guests at the restaurant. We all work in hospitality, this is not how things should be handled. We were left feeling quite embarrassed. The waitresses were lovely but never again, next time we will visit her at the Seamill Hydro. We felt like we were being thrown out after spending a lot of money here.

The Chilli Garlic Fried Rice was decent, but the Oriental Chicken dish was unexpectedly spicy, making it a bit challenging to enjoy. However, the reason for my 4-star rating lies in the consistent quality of food I've enjoyed in the past at Second Wife. The Kebabs, in particular, have always been a highlight, with their delicious flavors and perfect texture.

On arrival to set up decorations, I found the room had n't been cleaned and to be quite brutal-messy. There was tinsel and a coat hanger on the floor, bits and food droppings in the carpet, sticky and dirty tables not cleaned and left over balloons hanging from a previous party. I fully expected the room to be cleaned and tidy for booking. Why would a function room not be cleaned down and ready for the next party ?! I asked the 1 member of staff working why the room had n't been cleaned and he could n't answer why. He also did n't have a hoover to at least get rid of the food droppings. I then asked if the heating could be turned on as it was cold. I was advised the radiators did n't work. How is this acceptable when January is exceptionally cold and not have working radiators. When I had booked this venue I asked if the upstairs bar would be open, to which I was told yes, pending staffing. A few days prior I was told the bar would be open but again another issue on the day, only 1 staff member working on the downstairs bar. Later on someone else did arrive to open the upstairs bar but had to leave. I do n't expect party guests to keep going up and down the stairs to fetch drinks. A big issue for a 1st birthday party was having no baby change facilities. This should of been stated at the time of booking. I would assume in 2024 baby change & disabled facilities are important and mandatory. I can not comment on the food here as luckily we took our own. To finish the overall poor experience with this venue, I completely forgot to ask for the deposit money back once our party had ended. It taken a week of actually going to the pub, calling, leaving voicemails and text messages to obtain my deposit back. I wo n't be returning obviously or recommending to anyone for future.",0

It's not much of a stretch to say that for a ""short term one-off"" project you don't want to add public servant FTEs that then need to be served a redundancy when the project completes.
  
It's a lot harder to justify when you have:
\* project teams that move directly to the next project in the queue when their current one winds up
\* long term rollover contracts for ongoing service provision
  
The argument I do see that is hard to counter (currently) is high-demand contributor skills where the PS position is not paid that well, as the higher pay grades are for managers and directors+, so the only way to get those people are to offer high-paying contracts.

One would have expected at least one decent slice of meat and a couple of smaller slices( I chose only Turkey), however, despite there being well over half the turkey on display with lots of meat, he literally shaved five slivers off the base. When we last visited Lincoln, we had a couple of generous slices, sadly when I mentioned this he replied it now on weight. That fine, I understand the business has to make a profit, overheads are a killer, but he did not weigh anything and just guessed at what he was serving up. Our group of four were all shocked as to the amount we received so it was not just myself. On top of that, the restaurant was very quiet with only a handful of filled tables, we sat for nearly half an hour after finishing our meals before the waitress came to our table. Again, had they been busy serving lots of tables this would have been acceptable, but that was not the case.

 Miners have poured a record $74bn into the coffers of federal, state and territory governments, with the Albanese government pocketing $42.5bn in company tax revenue, and Queensland and NSW cashing in on booming coal royalties.
After Jim Chalmers announced a second budget surplus anchored by strong mining exports and commodity prices, an EY royalty and company tax payments report, released on Monday, reveals miners have paid governments almost $360bn in taxes and royalties over a decade.
With Peter Dutton promising a Coalition government will adopt a ""pro-mining mindset"" and the Greens demanding an end to coal and gas, Anthony Albanese is under pressure to balance Labor's emissions reduction ambitions with support for traditional mining.
Commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia, whose members include BHP, Rio Tinto, Lynas Rare Earths, Glencore and Peabody, the annual report shows a $9.3bn increase in payments to governments. The $74bn payday for governments in 2022-23 included a decade-high $31.5bn in royalties. As well as traditional mining revenue associated with iron ore and coal, The Australian this month revealed oil and gas companies are on track to pay a record $17.1bn in taxes and royalties across 2023-24.
With the mining industry paying the highest average wages, contributing the most company taxes and delivering the bulk of export revenue, MCA chief executive Tania Constable warned against holding back miners with ""draconian 1970s industrial relations agendas, high energy, environmental, planning and taxation costs"". The MCA will launch a national advertising blitz on Monday.
""The recent federal budget revealed that government spending is on the rise and it is our country's mining sector that foots the bill, paying more than half of the company tax paid by large corporations and international businesses,"" Ms Constable told The Australian.
""Despite underwriting our nation's prosperity, living standards and security, the path forward for the mining industry remains uncertain. Our tax system is increasingly uncompetitive, and our regulatory environment is becoming more cumbersome.
""Approvals are taking too long, tied up in endless red tape, well-funded lawfare and multi-layered government bureaucracy, wasting taxpayers' money and holding back Australia's economy from realising its full potential.""
Queensland's share of national royalty payments increased from 32.5 to 47.2 per cent off the back of higher coal royalty rates, with NSW claiming a $4.7bn royalties windfall. In the battleground election state of Western Australia, iron ore remained the biggest earner despite lower revenue and prices in 2022-23.
""Total mineral sector royalties reached approximately $31.5bn in 2022-23, increasing by $7.6bn from the previous year. The yearly growth in royalties was primarily due to an increase of $7.1bn in royalty taxes paid in Queensland due to the introduction of progressive coal royalty rates,"" the EY report said.
""Western Australia's royalty income is largely attributed to iron ore. In 2022-23, iron ore production volumes were similar to 2021-22, so changes in WA's royalties were largely driven by changes in iron ore prices.
""Iron ore prices declined in the second quarter of 2022-23 and remained lower in early 2023 due to production restrictions in China.""
With mining companies and associated supply chains supporting 1.1 million jobs, Ms Constable said the sector was helping keep ""Australia solvent"".
""A robust mining sector is critical if we want to sustain public spending, advance Australia's broader economic agenda, and keep the budget in the black,"" she said. ""This is revenue that supports families, builds communities, and funds essential services like the NDIS, childcare subsidies and aged care."".

Establishments that segragate an ddivide societies based on religion have no place in a modern world.  Catholics here, CofE there, other Potestants there, Muslims somewhere else, Jewish children in their own schools etc... I can not believe that this is tolerated in today's world after literally thousands of years of experience showing us what religion does to inflame and instigate grief, ignorance and violence.
If your religion is so important to you then send you children to after school classes.  Your beliefs should not impinge on my freedom to be educated undisturbed, on teachers' abilities to teach or on schools' abilities to teach.  Why should 90% of society move over every time someone says their ""faith"" means they need to interrupt?  If every religious minority did this society would simply grind to a halt.  Civilised society depends on everyone compromising in the face of facts not beliefs.  Your beliefs doe not trump my facts.

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"It really has come to something now. 
But as a time traveller from the past (i.e. I'm an old woman), I can totally remember *decades* of my life when women were blamed for being attacked. Raped during army training? ""What would she expect, trying to be a soldier?"". Raped in the town centre? ""What was she wearing?"" Raped in a car park? ""Well, it was her fault going out after dark"". (This literally happened to a colleague of mine in our company car park after work. This -and worse- was openly said to her).
Being ""openly a woman"" in a host of different everyday situations was just ""asking"" to be attacked. We hear less of that now-although I think a lot of women suspect that many police officers still think this way. But to spread this kind of openly prejudiced speech to racial/ethnic/religious groups, seems to be a rarer thing.
With the police's misogynistic attitudes, it's been the angry and loud protests of the public that has made them re-think: seemingly, this has had to happen in this instance regarding endemic police antisemitism.",0

Currently I'm helping 5 different people without any photo ID to get something sorted - the kind of vulnerable people who are either illiterate or mentally/physically ill - who have never worried about voting before. Just took their voting card to the polling station and voted - job done.
This was just the Tories doing their ""Wish we were the US GOP party...sigh"" dreamy eyes across the ocean, where they hope to have a proper dictatorship with no rules that effect their wealth accumulation, or challenges from those nasty poor people (i.e. anyone earning less than a million a year).
So funny that Bozo got caught out, but knowing him it was deliberate as he craves ANY attention whatsoever for his ""brand"".

>In Question Time the Opposition asked across the Chamber, surely the Government isn't asking nothers to delay having their babies, while they're transferred to other hospitals due to maternity closures? 
>With Labor suggesting women could just bypass their local hospital to go to another hospital to give birth, I could not believe Labor was telling mothers to ""cross your legs"" while in labour.
>This is the comment I made. 
>We have had women give birth on the side of the road in Queensland due to maternity services being closed in regional areas and this is what we were demanding the Health Minister answer for today.
>The comment was clearly not about the Health Minister, it was about the alarming Queensland Maternity Crisis, which continues to worsen on her watch and is putting women and children at risk. 
>Shannon Fentiman is aware I am a victim of domestic violence. She is also aware I am a mother. For her to mischaracterise my words for her own political gain and attempt to portray me as a misogynist is deeply offensive.

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.
My advice is that don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.
It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.
Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.
The analogy I'd use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box. What's in the box? It could be an empty box or full of lead weights. How could I ever know? You need to tell me. I sure as heck don't want the person carrying the box to hurt themselves and need back surgery.

Australia's education system is so messed up in so many ways but the most appalling aspect of our education system is this class divide that only seems to be worsening. Private schools receiving government funding is sickening, then even within the public system there are gross inequities. The whole thing needs a massive shake up but of course that won't happen because people are terrified of acknowledging the issues within the education system, let alone actually doing something about said issues.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I have a divergent view.
1. The main reason is soil. Australia is a very old country, which means a lack of good volcanic soils over most of the country. Lack of phosphorus and sulfur.
2. There's water in the outback, in the Great Artesian Basin. And a huge number of rivers and lakes. Mostly dry, but that still means subsurface water.
3. Australian deserts are covered in vegetation, all of them. Australia's famous Nullarbor has no trees, but still have as much vegetation as the American west.
4. When the explorer Sturt reached the most isolated point in Australia, he was met by a tribe of Aborigines who greeted him with a masonic handshake and knew how to tie boots.
In summary, it's Australia's poor soils that are the main reason. That and the lack of water which is exacerbated by inadequate steps to reduce water loss.",0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"A friend and I visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on Instagram as well as some recommendations. I start with the only positive thing I can remember about this unforgettable experience( for all the wrong reasons), the decor and interior was to a high standard. The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our 27 and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them.",0

Let's dial it back a bit towards teaching topics that require the university degree to perform. Then move out towards degrees that help with critical thinking and abstract thought, which can still help with generating ideas and new ways of working.
If money and spaces are so limited, we need to go back to using universities as a step into future work, not just a standard thing that everyone does before they get an unrelated job. That might get spending under control.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,Update 3 * I went to see Matilda at 3 pm on the 1st of December the film was good but felt let down by the quality of the sound was really flat with minimal bass especially on a musical film. I paid the extra for the premier seats whilst being a different colour and a slightly higher back they really ai n't comfortable and I was starting to ache so had to keep moving about in my seat to get through the film whilst the seats look good the comfort was n't considered when they were made especially for sitting in for around 2 hours. The picture quality was really good with good brightness level. I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film. I really would like to see different straws available as the straws currently just go soggy and collapse around 20 minutes into the film I had 2 and had failed before I finished my large drink I ended up using a spare straw when I got back to my car I had from showcase wich lasted well for the rest of the drink This cinema is good but I would n't use it as my first choice as cinemas are a big part of me and the sound image and comfort are really important things to me for a great cinema experience. I do really like the screens outside so you can check the film that's showing before you go in it's a great idea and works well( picture taken as I left so shows film time of the showing after the one I watched) Original 4 * I have n't been to a cinema in around 13 years i enjoyed my visit the person serving was friendly and really helpful we got are tickets and drinks we went for the large drinks because hey it's not a regular thing and might aswell go all out on it. The person scanning tickets could have been a bit more helpful I rely on things being made clear to me and because I seen the sign for screen one and not screen to as that was around the corner under the stairs it was difficult for me to understand wear it was the the person was friendly it would have been helpful to maby word and explain things a little different as some of us struggle with things like this also maybe move the sign for screen 2 so it can be seen as easy as screen 1 from wear the tickets get checked. The cinema was clean tidy and I really enjoyed the film we did notice that about of the way through many the Aircon came on or heating went off and started to get cold. We will be revisiting soon hopefully I really missed going to the cinema it was a really nice day out with going to the cinema at the end.,0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the ""unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government.""
On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.
""It's time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,"" he said.
Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.
""It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally  Israel  to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,"" Mr Leeser told The Australian. ""But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?"" ""This is not an environmental party,"" he said. ""This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.""
'What is Adam Bandt advocating for?': Labor MP questions Greens leader's announcement
Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.
Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not ""just a symbolic move.""
""It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,"" he said. ""It is a concrete step towards peace.""
""As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition."" Mr Bandt said the ""scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.""
""A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.""
He warned that a ""human engineered famine"" was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that ""amounts to collective punishment of these people.""
Mr Bandt said that Labor's credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you ""recognise just one side.""
""Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,"" he said. ""Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu."" Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting'un-Australian values'
Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.
""Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,"" Mr Watts said..
""Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,"" he said.
""Wedge politics only divides the community,"" he said. ""Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution  but the Greens aren't serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.""
""On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,"" he said. ""Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.""
But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. ""We see no role for them in this,"" he said. ""A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel's security.""
""We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority  We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.""
Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. 'End the occupation': Greens Leader calls for Labor to'take action' against Israel
""This motion  sends the message that Hamas' violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,"" he said. ""This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.""
He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women's rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the ""cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.""
Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had ""become a central plank of Green philosophy.""
""The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October  even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,"" he said. ""They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.""
Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC's Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.
Reflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed ""how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.""",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"As a Christmas gift, my wife and I went for an Afternoon Tea. This is something we do every year and we try out the different ones around Tunbridge Wells. Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n't see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n't think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n't risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n't quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n't hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more. There are other local Afternoon Teas that blow this out of the water.",0

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"The whole concept of ""hate speech"" is Orwellian and goes against the very tenets of liberalism, unless someone is making direct threats then they should not be prosecuted in any way for what they say, not only is it morally wrong to criminalise speech, but it is also foolish from an intellectual and humanitarian standpoint, ideas should be fought with ideas, that is the cornerstone of a liberal democracy and it's the best way we can help people change, its using a carrot rather than a stick.  Who decides what is considered hateful, politicians with their own agendas who are bought and paid for, a corrupt, unaccountable and unelected civil service, or strange pressure groups that are bank-rolled by big business and shady individuals. That is a very slippery slope to descend, their have been cases where comedians and writers have been prosecuted for simply making a joke or publishing a work, their was a case recently were a man was arrested for placing stickers on lamp posts, again regardless as to how distasteful you find their statements and views, it's morally objectionable that people should be thrown in prison for simply opening their mouths and expressing an opinion.

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"This is really about the reputation of the police. 
I'd love to be able to assume that the police wouldn't set a dog on someone without good reason.
Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.
I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge. I think it's also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers - probably most of them - would happily look the other way while that happened. I would expect this to be more likely if the guy had scorned the police officers involved, because they're extremely protective of their own hurt feelings, but that's another issue altogether.
I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.
The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it. If not, they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be, and the fact that they are usually shown to be (to all practical purposes) immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem.",0

Renewable industry? Green steel. Steel is massively energy intensive to produce. Build absolutely massive solar farms, use the raw materials here to build Green steel, export it.
Heck, if the government hasn't fucked everyone decades ago by selling off energy generation to the private industry, we could tempt manufacturing here by offering hugely discounted power pricing.
Never happened because of party politics. Decades of liberal scare campaign, ads showing the poor miners losing their jobs.
Basically, the tech exists to make the switch, thermal storage works great for overnight power. But the rich and powerful have easy access to politicians, so much so that the opposition leader took a flight across the country to spend 3 hours at a party with the human parasite known as Gina.

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""
Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as ""inconsistent"" with Direction 99.
Asked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a ""significant emphasis on serious offending and family violence  which need to be considered in all matters"".",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"""By July 2022 it was clear that MOWA did not have the required operational capability to engage directly with \[Meals on Wheels\] services, to implement Future Fit initiatives, nor manage operational software,"" the Miles Morgan final report says. ""NSW and QLD state associations agreed. Attempts were then made to work with the state associations directly, which enabled increased, direct contact with services.
""However, by 29 March 2023, South Australia, Tasmania and the NSW state association had opted out of Future Fit. Noting as at 8 September 2023 Tasmania has to \[sic\] re-joined following changes to their board and management team.""
By many accounts, MMA went to war with those who did not support the transformation initiative.
In a September 2023 submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the integrity of consulting services, Meals on Wheels Victoria state manager Alina Tooley said the mission to bring services together in a ""unified"" national network was being undercut by MMA.
""Rather than stabilising and modernising the network, MMA are creating more work for an already overworked sector, and causing confusion, disharmony and angst,"" the submission says. ""The national meals network is now less stable than prior to the commencement of Future Fit.""
In its own final report, MMA singled out Meals on Wheels Victoria for its ""multi-year campaign  to prosecute the problem, raise community fears and failure to offer a solution"".
As local councils increasingly look to get out of running Meals on Wheels services themselves, enormous gaps have emerged in a crucial but poorly funded segment of the aged-care sector.
In March last year, Aged Care Minister Anika Wells announced a $2.2 million pilot program through Meals on Wheels Newcastle and the Queensland body to take over the services vacated by Whitehorse and Ballarat local councils in Victoria. The funding was made through Future Fit, she announced.
Meals on Wheels Victoria was not approached to run the service.
Correspondence between Gunaratnam and health department secretary Russell Herald, who is the departmental signatory on the MMA contracts, confirms the consulting firm was deeply involved in the Whitehorse transition from July last year, right down to the details of the menu cycle, although MMA is not an accredited provider of home support services.
""How are we going with PDF's of the fortnightly menus?"" Herald asked MMA in October. ""Any chance by tomorrow.""
Herald, in his capacity as the contract owner and with aged-care policy responsibility for home support, has worked closely with MMA. In turn the consultancy has worked with an existing aged-care company, Polixen, which has long offered a desktop customer resource management (CRM) tool designed specifically for Meals on Wheels providers.
The vast majority of Meals on Wheels services in MMA's own surveys said they used Polixen software to manage clients' resources, delivery routes and rosters.
In the second official work order signed by Gunaratnam and Herald, MMA is required to ""build a replacement CRM"" for Meals on Wheels providers between 2021 and 2023.
To do this, MMA first subcontracted a Canberra firm named Agile Digital but relations broke down and MMA stopped paying for its services. Some work on the CRM had been done and MMA allegedly took this to a new company named GoSource. A contract between the two was developed in November last year. A CRM has still not been delivered.",0

If anything, you need to look at countries like Germany that have their government buildings in Berlin but the finance district in Frankfurt and services more evenly spread out across the country.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"It's going to take about 6 months for McBride's new lawyers to put together an appeal. I can't prove his innocence in a reddit post. I just want to draw attention to the case, especially the blatant corruption of this judge and what that represents.
Politicians may not really care about their donors paying less taxes, but their bosses do. I hope judges are mostly honest as they have usually decided to make less money than they would as lawyers. However, this one has shown too many signs of corruption. The people who appoint and promote judges are corrupt and McBride had secrets they wouldn't let the public know.
Also, the judge hid that sentencing was going to take place until a last minute change of plans. I believe that being more senior, more visible and less incentivised to appease politicians should mean judges of the high court are trustworthy (certainly a hundred times more trustworthy than Mossop). I believe they will overturn the  verdict or at least give McBride a lighter sentence. Unfortunately legislators are highly against whistle blowing..

I tried a few shops and vendors at Janakpuri west as well for Chinese food like a spring roll, momos, fries, etc. Momos are readily available and of great taste and quality but only a few here have spring roll in their menu. And I had them from two different shops-Tilak Momos & Chinese Thapa. But none of them were good. They were n't at all crispy, stuffing was also not so good.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"Why are people concerned about the government's profits? The government is not a profit making company. It is not supposed to be one.
Edit: Posting because the comment was deleted after i already typed the reply
>Because most of the govt losses are due to inability and inefficiency of their business models not because of subsidies and general expenditures. If govt runs a business smoothly atleast from that business it should be close to break even point if not profitable. 
>Overall agar expenditure se thoda loss ho toh that's not an issue, but even general PSUs are making heavy losses. They are supposed to make profit or they'll be privatised soon enough.
Government has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. 
They could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such. Who will be the customers? The same people who paid taxes for building the highways in the first place.

Over the course of three weeks, I found myself ordering from Subway a total of twelve times. While the variety and customization options were commendable, my dissatisfaction stemmed from two specific instances when I ordered double meat for both meals and received only a single serving in both. On both occasions, I had explicitly requested and paid for double meat, expecting a heartier meal. Unfortunately, the oversight resulted in a less satisfying experience. The inconsistency in fulfilling this specific order detail left me disappointed, considering the additional cost incurred for the extra protein. While the majority of my Subway visits were satisfactory, the repeated hiccup in delivering on the double meat order has left me contemplating the reliability of this particular customization. Despite this setback, the staff friendliness and the overall taste of the sandwiches somewhat mitigated the frustration.

The raw imports China gets from Australia are essential to China's economy (which is struggling) - they cannot quickly substitute the proximity and scale of iron ore, coal, gas, lithium etc that they get from Australia.

Exploring the priory feels like diving into a history book  you can practically hear the echoes of monks chanting. And climbing up the castle walls ?

The surrendering beach area below is like something out of a postcard. With its sandy shores and dramatic cliffs, it's the perfect spot for a leisurely stroll or a day of soaking up the sun. Overall, Tynemouth Priory and Castle is a must-visit if you're in the area.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I've been to Paris and (some decades ago), Shanghai.

It's the direct opposite of here where cars travel at speed on the same roads as bikes. 
I'd love to cycle more places, but bike helmets aren't putting me off, it's the lack of a safe cycling route that won't leave me on a bike at the mercy of a dickhead in an unnecessary 4WD and potentially dead or brain damaged.

The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"> continuing the Allan Labor Government's priority to make Victoria a safer place for women and children and work to end the tragedy of deaths of Victorian women at the hands of men.
How can domestic violence be a valid priority when more women and children die on the roads, if indeed death is the primary determinant of the program?
I'm assuming they mean women in Victoria rather than Victorian women (from the Victorian era) none of whom are still alive.
It's deceitful to blather on about number of deaths of women in domestic violence as justification, when more women die in other arenas, in order to support a program that aims to reduce domestic violence of a wide range of forms including raised voices.
Surely the focus should be on the worst triaged objective outcomes, not subjective hurt feelings; and on men who kill, not profiling all men for the actions of a minority.
Didn't we ban gay conversion therapy only to now implement a generic Men's Behaviour conversion therapy? Behaviour is in response to causative factors, it doesn't magically spring into being through immaculate conception. Perhaps we should be looking at causative factors in priority outcomes.",1

The Eggs Benedict and the other food all looked amazing-quality ingredients and well presented on the plate.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"On the face, a tired 1920s hotel with splendid views of Brighton seafront. With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n't like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n't underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms. If you looking for the wow factor, do n't stay here. If you looking a nice attentive hotel experience where you are looked after and get a good night sleep, this may be the place for you.

Pros: 
-Easier to keep clean
-Not overly or under sensitive 
-Less chance for it to get caught on anything if I go commando
-Phismosis is not a concern for me
Cons:
-Looks dry compared to uncut
-Being middle ground on sensitivity means you can still feel negative things 
-See above, then add in the textures of the wrong types of pants
-More likely that if I get sweat pimples, they can form around and even at the tip at times.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 
I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is ""Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance"" and has ""consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art"" costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 
A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn't it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn't throwing away stock. 
Perhaps I'm over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don't know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 
I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don't know what I'm talking about a I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that's as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I'm definitely not a customer of yours and I don't really care what the cost of a coffee is. I'm simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that's hardly the case now.",0

The NSW Coalition's most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a ""dereliction of duty"" after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.
In an extraordinary move, Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government's new laws, which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders, would pass without consultation.
The changes follow a string of high-profile alleged domestic violence offences, including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month.
Shadow attorney-general Alister Henskens said the Coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by Thursday.

The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens, the shadow attorney-general, argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws. He later said he had seen the government's press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.
Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor's laws.
However, Henskens' push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.
Greenwich said he had been in parliament for ""five premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments"", and he had never seen a proposal with ""such disrespect to stakeholders in this space"".
""I've never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don't want to consult with them,"" Greenwich said.
""They want to rubber stamp something they haven't ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.""
Leong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.
She said Henskens' attempts to ram through the bill smacked of ""relevance deprivation"".
Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.
""The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,"" Hoenig said.
Attorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that ""all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state"".
Domestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be ""considered properly"" before being passed.
On Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.
At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.
There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender's release in the Supreme Court.
A requirement for magistrates and judges to consider ""red flag"" behaviour such as animal cruelty, stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced, while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families.",0

The price was good maybe slightly higher than our local but within the ball range. The special fired rice was great and so was the gravy and the missus loved hers. But we always get a portion of salt and pepper chips and me being a fatty chicken, I think it was strips. Sadly the range brings it down. Feels more like an after thought than a proper dish.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The Space Shuttle was dealing with ordinary physical problems like two pipes making a good seal with each-other, and the fact that hydrogen atoms are so small they will actually leak out through a crystalline metal structure. That's physics.
No, we cannot make electrolysis more efficient than 1.6 units of electricity producing 1 unit of stored hydrogen energy.
* It requires 237kJ/mol to disassociate H2O into H2 and O2. \ That's the absolute theoretical minimum. 
* Burning hydrogen with oxygen releases 286kj/mol of heat energy \ 
* Thus, the theoretical maximum is requiring 1.2 units of electricity to produce 1 unit of stored hydrogen energy
* In practice, as the water electrolysis article will demonstrate, and the simple fact that heat engines are never 100% efficient (or we'd have 250% more energy from coal and gas-fired power stations than we do now), if we get 1.6:1 we're doing well.
* This ratio inevitably becomes worse because it requires energy to pressurise and refrigerate the hydrogen, since this requires 50kj/mol \
* and liquid hydrogen boils off during storage at a rate of 1-5%/day \[ibid\]
Again, it only makes energy sense if we have a massive surplus of renewable energy. But then if we have a massive surplus of renewable energy we don't need to store it, and don't have to store it in hydrogen or batteries, we can just waste it - unplug the solar PV, let the wind turbines spin without turning the turbines, and so on. 
It's simply a money-grab by mining companies from government, and a way to delay action on reducing fossil fuel consumption. Even nuclear is more sensible than hydrogen, and nuclear is a total subsidy suck which in around half the countries it's been instituted was a cover for a nuclear weapons programme.",0

* Used the Supreme Court to aid him
* Broke the law
* Has been ""on trial"" for 6 years, with massive fines and possible prison
* May be elected again.
Johnson: 
* Also met with foreign agents behind closed doors
* Also engaged in corruption and nepotism, literally ennobling family members and honouring his young female ""hairdresser""
* Also repeatedly lied and broke Parliamentary standards
* Lied to the monarch, personally unlawfully suspended the democratically elected Parliament in an attempt to bypass the government and directly rule the country through his office in order to crash the country out of international treaties and break legal international obligations
* Attempted to turn the people against the Supreme Court and subvert its independence
* Broke the law
* Received no punishment
* Was re-elected with a massive majority

It's not a racism thing, it's not an Australian thing. It's a social media thing. 
There is def casual racism in Australia, I'd like to think that a majority would call out a comment like this irl, but it depends very much on the context of who is saying it and where.

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese-style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients, no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over 45yrs. Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho.

This puts Labor in a position they're very comfortable in - lip service about the change they want, but only carrying out the changes they need (or believe they can afford) to make.
This is a fundamental issue with democracy under neoliberal and capitalist assumptions. It keeps the leftwing establishment from the proper work of nation building, keeps them ""tinkering around the edges"" as the article puts it - and allows for a ratcheting to the right of politics.
It's easy to cut taxes on wealth and big business donors. It's easy to take some money from here, put it there, to let Capitalism usurp your party's values over time. Much easier than standing up for your country, your values, or people who actually vote you in/out.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Interestingly I find that Docklands and Southbank are in a similar place of being hated but have totally opposite problems. 
Docklands has a decent ground plane with lots of space for shops, a nice street layout, and some good parks. But there is absolutely nothing to draw people to the area. It's in a weird spot off to the side of the city so people aren't just happening upon it or travelling by. It's become a quiet residential area. 
Southbank on the other hand has lots to draw people to it and lots of people pass through, but is just a terrible place to be in (except along the river front). No one considered how people would interact or move through the space. The towers provide very little ground amenities, and everything is separated by massive roads which are unpleasant to be near. 
The great spots in Melbourne tend to have a great ground plane, lots to see and do, excellent walkability, and are central to something or somewhere.",0

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"My wife and I had n't dined here before, but an electrical outage resulted in us selecting a venue we've never visited instead of cooking at home. Walking in on a weeknight with no booking was met nonchalantly-with a very professional young bloke looking after us. I'm just going to throw this out-service levels in Australian restaurants are generally not fantastic. Not so here-a slight eye contact with our server resulted in him quietly making his way to our table-this is USA grade service minus the intrusiveness and tipping aspect-an absolute credit to this waiter and the venue. A young lady at the bar was also wonderfully attentive and pleasant. The dining area was dimly lit and quiet. We did feel a little underdressed in our work uniforms but were assured this was n't an issue. Drinks were served quickly( and there's Malbec on the wine list!). We deliberated on mains. My wife does n't normally order the steak, but settled on the medium rare rump-with salad and greens( a novel twist) with a sticky jus. I chose the medium rare eye fillet with salad and chips, and my eyes lit up when I saw Barnaise sauce on the menu as an option. Barnaise is a warm, emulsified daughter sauce of hollandaise and one of the best steak pairings alongside asparagus in my opinion. It makes a good steak great when executed well. Both our steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare-this is unusual in Toowoomba where consistency of doneness is generally poor in most venues. The steak quality was great-even the rump was tender and consistent in texture. Sauces were sadly lacking. A good jus has a gelatinous, concentrated quality that clings to meat-this one was watery, overly sweet and tasted artificial. Did I mention Barnaise is meant to be served warm ? It was served in a small ramekin, straight out of the refrigerator and lacking shallot and tarragon in both taste and appearance-it appeared to be a food service grade hollandaise. We did have room for dessert, and the Crme Brle here was delightful-the shallow ramekin made for a perfect balance between the custard and crunch of the sugar.",0

The lack of marketing for this event compared to others was shocking and the fact the people running it rang to check if under 18s were allowed multiple times and they were then turned away was abysmal.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I'm sick of arguing with every opinionated ignoramus who hasn't made an effort to understand this case.
Firstly, if you are going to accuse me of wildly engaging in misinformation, it would be nice if you did me the courtesy of reading what I write until you comprehend it.
Both the judge and I distinguished between the cases deemed most comparable and those that were simply mentioned. One of the cases that was merely mentioned was about a lawyer stealing $220 000 from a disabled client (which is a lot worse than blowing the whistle), another that was merely mentioned was about stealing work tools. You've skimmed the conclusion of the judgment and cherry picked the least relevant and in one case most evil cases you could find.
I can't take you seriously if you pretend it's a coincidence the sentencing was held on budget day. That and the harshness of the sentence despite all the considerations I've listed are evidence of the judge's bias.
The Nazis obeyed orders and Stanislav Petrov disobeyed them, those are my points.
As his new lawyer will argue in court, he had duties that prevailed to the extent of any other duty. He could not have held his position as a military lawyer without having this duty. The proceedings in the High Court will shed light on this and most likely result in McBride being exonerated or at least given a better sentence for a whistle blower.
It's a lot easier to prove illegal procedures in investigating cases before you, than to prove cases of war crimes your superiors don't want you to see. If you look at the extracts of McBride's statements to police in the sentencing transcript, they will shed light on his motivations.
His previous lawyers took a very limited approach in defending David. Perhaps Mark Davis saw this case too much like a journalist (which he was) and that is why he didn't devote his time to making contingency plans in case his main argument was dismissed.
You are referencing the defense department investigating itselfwhen McBride concerns were with the leadership of the defense department.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.
Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry's services.
Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a ""limited-term contract"" in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads' licensing and registration arms  a deal due to expire in the 2060s.
The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was ""hoping to close any deal by the end of the year"".
A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria's bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.
A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.
""It can probably be done better,"" the minister said.
The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.
Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.
Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.
""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.""
The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.
Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.
The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.
Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.
But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.
Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.
Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.
""Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.""
Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"".
""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security  cybersecurity in particular  could quite quickly run into trouble.
""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.""
Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.
The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report.
The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.
It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.
The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.
Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.
The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.
Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.
When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.
""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time.
""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.""
The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria's coffers.
Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.
However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next 40 years.",0

The staff and service was fantastic exemplary from start to finish. We had the Karage Chicken, Spicy Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki to start. The Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki were brilliant, but the Karage chicken a little disappointing. It was the crispiest chicken I have ever eaten, but it was n't very flavoursome-even with the dip. We followed this with Beef Bibimbap and Salmon Bibimbap. Both of these were brilliant-the hot beef comes in a searing hot iron bowl and continues to sizzle the whole time you eating it!

Generally everything I had here has been good but in this review I be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day. The prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than I prefer. Personally I like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour, but that just me. The prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though. The steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked. The meat was n't as warm as I liked and the caramelised onions were n't as flavoursome as they looked to be. Overall you could n't taste much else and the sandwich( 22 I think) was only half a sandwich. Would have liked the whole thing for that price. The chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain. Tasted like there was n't any seasoning at all on them. A jug of lemon-lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better. Will have to write another review the next time I visit.",0

And I am a fan of Russian jets. I just love the sukhoi's.
But there are several reasons to not buy Russian jets. 
1. Russia is also friends with China, and china also own a few variants of sukhoi's, even the variants of su-30(su-30mki is the backbone of Indian Air force).
Infact Chinese jets are half stolen US reverse engineered tech and the rest is russian. 
2. Rafale's are in a league of their own, a few years ago french forces, claimed to have won a dogfight with f-22 raptor in a friendly exercise.
3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes/ maintainance times than western jets and their engines.
4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale)
5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense
6. Rafal's are launched by catapult whereas Russian aircrafts by ski jump. (Catapult is considered to be superior).
7. Also the diversification factor.",0

More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg.

Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly.

One might possibly attempt to construct an argument that if these were British owned ventures doing their best we should cut them some slack
However, like everything else, the uk water industry was sold off by maggie in the'80s.   Not only that, the government took on 45 billion of debt  - or more accurately made taxpayers responsible for the debt.

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Trigger warning: I've lost respect for the profession. The information they pedal is mostly out of date and harmful and is designed to generate revenue for pharmaceutical companies. 
I followed their advice for 8 years to treat depression, an autoimmune disorder and Costochondritis. All that happened was I got worse. 
They told me the Costochondritis was a'systemic inflammation disorder'. Turns out it's not at all. It is in fact a hinge seizure and is mechanical in nature, with the inflammation being a byproduct. Physio to mobilise the joint was the solution and worked in a matter of weeks. If I'd continued listening to my GP I'd still have it, as many do. 
My GP was extremely happy to prescribe handfuls of pills that made me significantly worse but refused to approve my diet following years of personal research. 
After 18 months of eating right, I went back for a check up. ALL of my symptoms are gone and I'm healthier than I've ever been. Cholesterol, BP, blood volume, hormone regulation, artery health etc are all the best they've ever been and all I did was stop eating most carbs, processed food and instead ate plenty of red meat.
Wanting to help people is genuinely honourable and I appreciate their intent, but I don't really want to fund misinformation anymore. There are many people in my position who haven't been able to figure it out. It's time the health system got on board with actually improving health, with the help of real data, rather than merely selling products with studies paid for by the producers designed for maximum profit. 
I know people are going to whinge about this being pseudoscience and anecdotal but the result speak for its self and anyone who knows me can see the difference at at glance. The health industry is collapsing!",0

From the first bite of their famous chicken, I was impressed. The chicken was cooked to perfection, surpassing its competitors in the charcoal chicken game. The serving size was generous, and the value for money was excellent, priced at just under 18 for a half chicken, chips, garlic dip, and a drink. It's probably the best charcoal chicken I've had in Victoria, and I've tried quite a few! It's important to remember that El Jannah is a charcoal chicken shop, not a fine dining restaurant. Despite this, the quality of the food is exceptional, and it's evident that they take pride in what they do. If you're in Dandenong and craving some delicious charcoal chicken, El Jannah is definitely the place to go. recommended!",0

Anyway he's leaving a few months before his 12 month contract.
I had to option to charge him the leasing and advertising fee. I choose not to charge this but I will hold him to paying the rent until I find someone else.
I won't be picky about the new tenant as long as they have a job and reasonable rental history just like I would for any tenant. Single mothers no problems.
Even in a rental crisis It does take time to find a tenant. Just most people who want to rent a place will want to move in after 2 to 4 weeks (gives them time to exit their current living arrangement).
I've always found the winter months are harder to find a tenant as most people start their lease at the end of or start of the year.
If an employer who gave you a 12 month contract, suddenly cut it short, would you not want to be compensated for the time you don't have a job. 
Sure you could find another job quickly but you wouldn't accept just any job would you?",0

Secondly would be the classic housing subsidy program. The sort of thing we've seen fail again and again. 
Thirdly would be social housing spending. Which would'merely' move to slowly and slightly solve the housing crisis of rental costs of the bottom 10% of households.

It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'.

There is something far more divisive and violent in these style of protests which seems different to others and one needs to ask the question especially since we are dealing with students and education is what is the impact of social media, foreign influence and other factors to drive polarisation.
This isn't tin foil hat land, we have clear evidence of this taking place in the US.
I am centre left in my political views, I advocate for a Palestinian state but similarly I defend falsehoods with regards to Palestinians and the Arab nations taking no agency on how this conflict unfolded considering post ww 2 we had many countries and borders redrawn and fair unfair or indifferent most borders have settled yet when I speak to a pro Palestinian it's just hate and anger with random incoherent points that this cohort keeps repeating with absolutely no ability to take even a drop of responsibility. There is no room for dialogue or robust debate, there is no appetite to learn, there is no appetite for reconciliation, it's pure anger and hatred. I am at a loss as to how one gets to this point and am personally hurt and disappointed at the level of demonisation of my people whom I believe for the most part align strongly with western values, contribute positively to society and by enlarge as a group probably lean more left than not, engage in humanitarian causes, strong culture of philanthropy/charity and loyal to the countries they reside in",0

Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,"The once-famous McDonald establishment seems to have experienced a decline in quality, particularly noticeable in the taste and freshness of their signature burgers. The burgers, which were once a hallmark of consistency, now lack the flavorful profile that patrons came to expect. The degradation in taste suggests a departure from the quality standards that contributed to McDonald reputation. Freshness, a key element in fast food, is an area that requires significant improvement. The ingredients do n't seem as vibrant or as crisp as they used to be, impacting the overall dining experience. The lack of freshness detracts from the essence of a fast-food meal, and it's a deviation from the standards that customers have grown accustomed to over the years. Moreover, the current taste of the burgers no longer justifies the price point. Previously, McDonald was synonymous with affordability and taste, but the recent changes in flavor do n't align with the cost. The value proposition seems to have shifted, leaving customers feeling that the quality no longer justifies the expenditure. In summary, the McDonald under review has faced a decline in the quality of its burgers, marked by a loss in taste and freshness. These aspects, coupled with a perceived mismatch between taste and price, indicate a departure from the standards that once made this establishment a go-to for fast-food enthusiasts. It may be crucial for the management to address these issues to restore the trust and satisfaction of their customer base.",0

Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff / service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do!

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.
Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.",1

No one expects the broker to work for free. But you don't need a PhD in behavioural economics to understand that, if a service is chosen by a party which not only doesn't pay the bill, but gets a cut, then the result will be inflated prices.
The problem here is not that the broker gets a commission - it is that insurance commissions are shared between brokers and managing agents/freeholders. But the bill is paid by the leaseholders.
This creates an incentive to choose the more expensive policy, if it pays a higher commission.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"It sounds like you're chasing the life we're told we're supposed to want and appreciate every single day of our lives. It doesn't get better because most of us still miss the thing we need most- community, real community. Here's another perspective and a blunt one: I have it'all', a 3mil house with no debt, I run a business that I only work 5 hrs on per week, I have a great husband and two beautiful sons. We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community. And it took me 10 years and money to realise that I'm deeply bored and unhappy. Nothing really excites me, except my kids milestones and smiles. How is that doing anything for the world? Just sitting here unhappy making money for the government in my secure safe little box. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I think most people hit this realisation ar a certain age and you only have a choice to keep at it or fuck it all off.
So we are selling our home and business this year, travelling to poorer countries, helping how we can, and experiencing life outside of the box. I feel SO MUCH better, SO relieved that there's'more'. I'm actually elated, I rarely had that feeling anymore for years.
What I'm getting at is, it's unlikely a job and house and family will make you feel better. Assuming you're not depressed, just stuck in the cycle. Deep dive into who YOU are - not what you're told to be, and there's always an answer. Then just say yes.",1

Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,"I recently visited Al Baik fried chicken restaurant and overall, I had a satisfying experience. The fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of KFC, which is quite an accomplishment. The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it. I hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future.",0

When we arrived 5 minutes before the hour, our table was n't ready, understandable as we were early. This was n't a huge issue as we got a drink and sat in the bar area, however, we had still not been seated by. We asked a member of staff how much longer we would be waiting, and conveniently the table was ready straight after asking, with no apology for the delay. There was a live singer which was a nice addition to our experience, however, we were unfortunately seated in the small side room( with around 5 tables) near the entrance, away from the main restaurant and the better atmosphere. We could hear the singer, but would have preferred to be in the main restaurant. We love that this place offers both spanish and cuban tapas as well as other main dish options. To eat, we opted for some tapas dishes so that we could share them. We ordered; the hummus, chorizo lollipops, roja vieja, seabass, verdura jambalaya, belly pork and patatas bravas. The portions were of a good size and nicely presented. Most of the food was really tasty as well, although we did feel that the batter covering the chorizo lollipops was very soggy and quite bland. The hummus definitely needed another slice of bread for the amount of hummus. The roja vieja tasted absolutely amazing, the beef was cooked to perfection with so much flavour, however, this was only served with one small taco, which meant as we were sharing( which is what most people do with tapas) we had to half the taco meaning there was loads of meat for only half a taco. All of the other dishes were up to a great standard. This visit was n't our first to Qubana and it wo n't be our last, but we hope that next time we will be in the main restaurant.",0

When i tried to show him all the actual facts he refused, it was all ""c'mon mate Labor are just a bunch of wannabe socialists who spend all our money and get us into debt, the Libs have their bad points but EVERYONE knows the Libs are the best economic managers""
The same guy who railed about ""Labor breaking their promise!"" on the stage 3 tax cut even though he himself got a larger cut than he would've under the Liberals. There's some people you can't help",1

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"While labour and materials are the biggest cost inputs into homes trades who work for domestic builders arent even on that much. 
High wages defenitely afflict high rise builders though especially in victoria. 
But what does my head in is the liberals are all over this new car tax and yet they introdiced GST on homes, then mainly labor state governments introduced developer levies, councils more charges. 
So we have liberals crying foul on a 15k impost on 4x4s but then the 150k plus in taxes from homes - 15bn odd per annum we dont say the same - what does this 150k do to the proce of all homes.
To my mind it is a bigger issue of justice and equality that homes are made more expensive by tax than 4x4s and i drive and holiday in 4x4s. 
Why is this not on the radar? Why can we go; congrats labor spending 2bn on supply while we milk 15bn back out as generous to prospective first home buyers. 
I mean we are literally putting a tax on these 4x4s of 15k to discourage them but then dont care we have 150k odd on a new home and wonder where is the supply.",1

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"This outlet is in the same location as the now defunct 2TG Thai was located in. Convenient location at Red Edge, no issues with parking. Food-BIR style curry that's prevalent in Australia( standard curry base which is built upon to order). Beef Bhuna with garlic naan. The flavour profile of the Bhuna was quite good-heat was on point and well spiced. Texturally sound as well( I dislike overly smooth gravies, which this fortunately is n't). Cumin forward on the flavour profile( quite dominant). Whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet-Bhuna is a dry curry and I wish it was n't served drowned in gravy. Maybe this is what other customers prefer-I like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid. The naan was a little disappointing, lacking the smoky tandoor flavour I'm used to, and there was n't a pronounced garlic flavour. Service-absolutely lovely. Both the lady serving and the gentleman in the kitchen were smiling and welcoming. Atmosphere-what I would expect for a small Indian outlet. Clean and well attended to.",0

The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.
Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.
The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).
It was about 1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.

I would HIGHLY recommend against doing this on a ct110. You have sections where extended highway speeds are required and you will be under that. Lots of heavy vehicle traffic and angry drivers.
Edit:  I wanted to add to this now I'm not on my phone.  The section from Ceduna to Norseman is approximately 1200km during which you have basically no option other than traveling along the highway.  The highway itself has long sections where there is no paved ""breakdown"" lane to the side.  The edge of the lane is the edge of the paved surface.  In addition that highway carries a very large amount of heavy traffic, and loaded with supplies you're going to absolutely max out at 80kph and likely spend a lot of time under it.
You're going to be constantly overtaken by a mixture of very large trucks and grey nomads with caravans and you will have nowhere to go.  You will be stuck with no paved surface to ride on and either have to run onto the dirt, the surface of which is very inconsistent, or hope to hell you don't get smooshed as they overtake.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"It isn't always about a sense of pride.
It is more about the market and what make sense economically.
For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players
Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.
Why?
1 The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.
2 Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.
3 Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost

The problem is created by government policy and can only be solved through changing laws. 
We are governed by political interests that undermine economic interests. 
It's like asking the children to run the kindergarten. 
All of these essential services and healthcare, aged, doctors, teachers, are all ultimately being paid for by taxpayers. 
Increasing their salaries only increases our inability to afford it. 
There is no doubt that we need to raise the minimum wage to meet the demands of the cost of living. 
$30 per hour is not unreasonable.
However you would currently after a 38 hour week receive 
$930 a week. 
At $29 per hour you would be getting $905 . 
If we just paid a basic minimum wage of $550 per week and a flat tax rate of 47 percent then we could actually pay people to look after our elderly at $20 per hour. 
Far more affordable. 
They would be receiving $907 a week nett. 
Someone receiving $30 per hour would be on $1154 per week nett, hundreds more. But only $15 a week nett to the government in cost. 
People can then work 5 hours or 50 , we don't spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset's and everything little things they earn. 
You cut off hundreds of thousands of pages of red tape. 
Government departments should be running as they are all part of the same organisation, but they don't. 
They have no idea how to cooperate with each other and work together towards a common cause. 
All fighting for their own patch of money and funding.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.
The saga of Miles Morgan Australia's involvement in the ""Future Fit"" turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.
It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.
Miles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.
Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.
Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.
Miles Morgan Australia's involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.
Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.
The government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had ""a deep understanding"" of the needs and a ""strong working relationship with the Department"".
""This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department's requirements,"" the submission prepared for Colbeck says.
""This procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.""
Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an ""open tender"".
That contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.
Within months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the ""capability"" for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.",0
Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,">Yet even in light of this, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton complained last week that the number of public servants has swelled under the Albanese government, declaring the Coalition sees defence spending as ""much more of a priority than office staff in Canberra"".
Gonna skip the usual Morrison circlejerk (oh Scott Morrison exercised political savvy to do no actual work? Shocker /s) and just highlight this point - the LNP will whinge Labor does nothing, but when Labor actually hires real staff to do work (more on ""real"" in a sec) now it is ""hiring for the wrong sectors/wasting money on'too good' public servants"" and other bullshit.
I say ""real"", because the alternative is pure contractors, which often cost more than regular staff (since the worker and the company has to make a profit or else cut corners to make money) and yet are seen as ""good"" because hey you create private sector jobs (which are magically worth more than public sector jobs because ???).
Anyway, nice to see Dutton falling back to classics /s.",1

I was on the top floor, which was lovely and quiet. I felt like I was the only person staying on that floor, which is a testament to how peaceful it was! However, whoever had cleaned the room prior to my check in had left the windows open( in February!) so it was freezing cold. After shutting the windows and plugging in the two small electric heaters provided, the room was still VERY cold during the whole of my stay. The underfloor heating was on but there were no controls in the room to turn it up. Whenever I was in my room, I had to get under the bed covers and keep both heaters beside me to take the edge off the chill. There were no extra blankets provided in the room.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"As a niche-interest protest party, the Greens care little about the impact their hardline positions would have on ordinary Australians. The undergraduate and destructive stance taken by Greens leader Adam Bandton the October 7 terrorist attacks byHamas against Israelis proof enough of the harm the far-left party poses toAustralia's community cohesion
The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but, as outrageous as the anti-Israel stand is, it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government. When allowed to get close to the levers of power  as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government, and with a balance-of-power position in the federal Senate today  theGreens are exposedfor the wreckers they are.
The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy  most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups  has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation's environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.
Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government's corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.
The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government's wider agenda. This includes housing, where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner-city seats. Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties. For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression. The Greens, once again, have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions.",1

The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of "" scruffy "" experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.",0

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,">Sure, going to a prestigious university opens doors, though I suspect most of the people in those universities had a lot of doors already open.
University is a class gateway
It used to be a stamp of approval that said ""yep, this guy's posh, he's one of the old boys, give him a job""
Then people saw that university graduates had better outcomes and thought it was something about university itself. So they started pushing loads of people through essay writing courses with no practical application
To be clear, I think education is valuable for its own sake. It's not inherently a waste of time to study something non-vocational 
But as an attempt to change society it kinda goes nowhere
So now that stamp of approval is meaningless unless it's from Oxbridge or maybe a Russell Group uni. It does however come with a shit ton of debt!

I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"A lot of people of your age with hot blood will advise you to stand up for yourself and leave the house as soon as possible. Please don't do that. By leaving the house or fighting back, you will not solve anything. You are perhaps too young to understand a few things, and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful. Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.
I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 
We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 
The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.
The only answer is unconditional love and respect.

Let's just say that service woild be nice to have but not expected. During the seating, the staff were great. I loved how we were nearly finished with the meal, and we were the only table not offered dessert menu when every other table was offered this. We have also overheard that the dessert here was good to try. Guess we will never find out. Instead, we were told we have 10min left as there is a second seating after us. We were never told this when we were seated. Standing around waiting to pay the bill was a lengthy process. We expected two options, either pay at the table or pay at the counter as you leave. We typically do n't want to waste time so we always head towards the counter. Little did we know this counter was shared with the front desk serving customers entering the restaurant. So we have to wait for 2 parties to be seated before we could pay and leave. Would highly suggest separating bill payment and ushering incoming customers since there are more than enough staff. Food is presented nicely, however is very dear for the portion size. Wallaby dumplings, the meat was tougher than the standard consistency of dumpling meat, however tasted okay with the sauce. The duck pancakes was an interesting twist to Peking duck pancakes with smokey duck. This is something you should try if you come here. Pork cutlet was okay, a different twist to crispy skin pork.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"This TGI Fridays in Telford provided a consistently enjoyable dining experience. As a fan of American cuisine, I found their menu to be diverse and satisfying. From the moment I walked in, the energetic and lively atmosphere immediately set the tone for a fun dining experience. The staff at TGI Fridays were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit. Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours. However, the staff did their best to manage the crowd efficiently and keep waiting times to a minimum. Nevertheless, it's advisable to book a table in advance to avoid any potential delays. Despite the wait, TGI Fridays in Telford consistently delivers a reliable dining experience. The food is consistently flavorful, the service is attentive, and the environment is vibrant. Whether you are looking for a casual meal or a place to celebrate with friends, TGI Fridays is a great choice.

Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,"The Sir Mark Cubbon statue in Bangalore, set within the verdant expanse of Cubbon Park, is a historical monument dedicated to Sir Mark Cubbon, the British Commissioner of Mysore from 1834 to 1861. His tenure is often remembered for the administrative reforms and infrastructural development he brought to the region, significantly influencing the city layout and public administration system. The statue commemorates his contributions to Bangalore, serving as a bridge between the past and present. Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history. Although opinions on colonial figures are complex and varied, the presence of the Sir Mark Cubbon statue provides an opportunity for reflection on the layers of Bangalore history, offering insights into the forces that shaped the city. This monument stands not just as a piece of art, but as a historical marker that prompts discussions about legacy, governance, and the impact of colonial rule in India.",0

Very friendly and attentive staff who also had a good knowledge of the building history which was nice to hear. Went for a late lunch and took advantage of their fixed price two course menu, a couple of cocktails and some bread and olives. Very large bowl of olives which was nice, they were pitted and we do prefer non pitted as tend to be more flavourful, however these were still enjoyable and a good sized portion. Bread was reasonable but nothing outstanding. Bruschetta nice, sweet tomatoes and fresh, street pizza found a little sloppy and a bit bland personally. Mains an Arrabiata sauce they kindly changed penne to spaghetti for my partner, pasta nicely cooked, sauce could have used a little more chilli, simple but tasty overall. I had the Carbonara which tasted creamy but as I had a little bit of a cold I'm not sure if it actually had a touch of cream but it certainly was n't a full cream base which was good. I did find it although rich slightly bland in both the pancetta and the cheese, again I had a slight cold but expected the flavours to be a bit more punchy. Could n't manage a dessert but we did both go for a liqueur coffee, myself a Scottish and my partner an Italian, both were pleasant and well made. The two cocktails as well had a decent measure of alcohol, quite well balanced flavour wise and whilst I've had much better they were certainly enjoyable. Definitely would give it a try again, sniffle free to give a fair shot.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,To be honest there are no service at all. I order dine in but they give me in a take way box. Table was not clean. Waiting time to long for food. Stuff are not the much capable( my own opinion) to maintain everything.,0
Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,Selected food is amazing. Few of their items not available but the taste is amazing. Very very costly proper enjoy the food and side will coset 6000 for two. Parking is not comfortable. Still good review for their service and food taste. Please keep a smile with us.,0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,This a beautiful park in the centre of Hull City. It has evolved in recent years from investment into the City and is changing for the better. I love the flowers by the fountain in the shape of a ship wheel that set the scene and you can sit and eat. Lots of events occur here too.,0
Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,This restaurant is better option in this area. Sitting arrangements are good. The dining hall is air conditioned. Every thing is neat and clean. The is also arrangements for both ladies and gents toilets. I personally think the menu is not at costly side according to the services and arrangements. Food preparation and taste are satisfactory. But one thing it take huge amount of time to prepare food. Not recommended if anyone has hurry.,0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"A little pricey  but the location is great, rooms are good, bed is comfortable, staff are nice, food is alright. The chair in the Premier Plus rooms is not very comfortable, but I always been confused why there even is a chair / sofa in hotel rooms  I only sat on it once to try it. Overall, probably the best Premier Inn I stayed in, I could n't really expect anything more from a budget hotel.",0
Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,yet my dad who lost job after 14 years could not even get JSA and when he did they only gave him 150 a week that only covered his fuel/lunch he prepared at home to go for a job they asked him miles away. lovely that UK Tax payers get barely much after they worked and paid taxes.,0
Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"So we should deport Australian criminals as well then?
Not sure how the safety argument applies. If they have been sentenced they are in prison. If they've served their sentence, then we don't have an issue (unless you think the sentence is less than it should be, in which case this also applies to Australian criminals).
Deportation, if you think it's a safety issue, just puts the problem on another country's hands. It's called bad behaviour if you shove your own problems onto others.",1

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"The food was Average, but it was expensive and the portion size was miniscule, I had to cook another meal after i finished the one I got from Sami. I could n't believe how small the portion of meat was when I took it out of the container. Being nickle and dimed for every single add on like sauces should have been a warning. Edit: Just to clarify I did indeed purchase Adult size meals.",0

For a mid-sat shift, I would be looking to ensure the 4 staff putting out stock were on tills instead! A queue of 6 people with big shops needed to be addressed quicker.",0
Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,Found them in woolies. They aren't the same.,0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,Got the Chicken n chips was the chicken was abit too thick for my liking but the sauces. The guy that was making the chips very friendly and the guy at the till that was putting the chicken and sauces on the food was not very friendly at all abit like a robot like he did n't want to be there!

From the entrance, to every round of mini golf, bowling alleys, signage, bar and carousel-it makes you feel like you at a carnival. The staff are friendly and professional. The whole layout does n't feel too cramped compared to most arcades. Before 6 pm is family friendly hours if you bring children under 18. After 6 pm, alcohol is served at the bar. Family friendly before 6 pm and great for small to large groups.",0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,A pure vegetarian restaurant. Went on a Sunday. Was n't that crowded. Friendly staff. The rose lassie and mango lassie were good but bit too sweet. The chili planner was good.

Ice bucket eventually arrived, filled to the brim with ice, no room for the bottle ? Got our own food, cheap but small portions. Not a great choice. My beetroot wellington was crushed into my plate.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,It a cute little cafe in a heritage building. Nice decorated. Pulled pork roll was the highlight while avocado toast and chicken waffle were slightly too salty. Coffee were just ok but butterbing cookie was very good.,0

Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,"The food was good. They serve food till 1 o clock at night People who love to have food at late night this is the place. They serve fried rice, noodles, parotta, egg varities, dosa varieties and sides. Even at late night i was able to get mutton chukka No parking is available.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Uninspired, tbh. Seemed to be a distinct lack of variety of products, though all the aisles were pretty full. So lots of the same. Staff seemed stressed and less helpful than usual. Seems to me that staff numbers have been cut so the remaining staff were very busy. Prices were noticeably less competitive. We do n't have an Asda near where we live, so we usually enjoy the all too rare visits, but not this time. The Issa brothers have a lot to answer for.",0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Good store, never had a problem with it apart from your one certain member of staff. His name is David. He is quite a big guy and grey longish hair. He absolutely stinks. He has hopped onto a bus I use before and as soon as he comes on all the people open windows and avoid breathing. Have also walked down an isle he been working in and he has a terribly foul smell from him. Why are you guys happy with having such a smelly guy working for you around customers ? It not a hard thing to shower and use deodorant. I sure he does nightshift but not 100 % sure of that. I not saying he should be sacked but I saying you need to talk to him and tell him how bad it is and not fair for other people like myself. I ca n't imagine what it like for staff having to work and share a staff room with him.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding.",1

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,My take out from this described shambles is that the coalition are meaningfully engaged in this debate and we can expect a much argued and defensible policy that has had plenty of darts thrown towards it internally. The ALP haven't noticed how much people are feeling the economy. Immigration keeps us from entering a technical recession while reducing our security of shelter by decades.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,This is a friendly pub situated in the centre of Tamworth. Situated around the room are several televisions showing an assortment of football matches. The locals created a very mature and friendly atmosphere without the younger element. Food was served which was hot. On my visit I enjoyed a great meat pie which came with a lot of meat. Some gravy to compliment would have been good. I will visit again. A great selection of beers too.,0

The rice was extremely dry as if it had been burnt left out for ages on the side. The potatoes in the curry were barely cooked and the chicken was mediocre. I asked for fresh rice and it was just as bad. I did n't finish my meal and left hungry. The coleslaw was good though. Service was average, nice guys but slow service.

Luckily I ordered an extra garlic sauce as none came with the kebab and the salad was basic, no cabbage. The wrap that came with the kebab was beautiful though. Pizza was OK but nothing special, plus the schwarma had an overwhelming taste of cinnamon which did not go with pizza. Really disappointed wo n't be going back.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I don't think cost is the issue for most people as to whether they use public transport or not.
It's have a frequent, reliable and pleasant service that gets them from A to B in a reasonable time. They're willing to pay for that.
Quite often the A or B aren't on the network, and if they are, the service is not frequent, reliable or pleasant. People aren't willing to pay for that. The outer suburbs of Melbourne are an unfortunate example of this. Nobody's walking 1.5km to stand at a bus stop in the sun or rain for a bus that comes once every 45 minutes and is often late or cancelled so they can then walk 1.5km at the other end. They'll just drive instead, if they can possibly afford it.
Even with the much better trains in Melbourne, they're often late or cancelled due to trackworks, whether building new tracks and stations or fixing up old lines. You can't plan, ""Let's visit the city this weekend and go to Vic Market,"" you might find yourself taking a 90 minute bus journey instead of a 25' train journey, and falling over every time the overcrowded bus lurches to a stop or swings around a corner.",0

To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019. The price was also I felt too high, our bill came in at 77, which if it had been more like 50 I would have been perfectly happy.",0

The lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender, juicy and succulent as the last. The rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish( as opposed to just the pitta or chips) it was ' warming ' and had a gentle, buttery taste. Interior was simple, yet beautiful; a modern and classic mixed look.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread, featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri-salted chips and chili cheese bites. The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates. I enthusiastically recommend Amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence.",0

I feel that unless you have a career plan after moving back to India, the best option is moving your parents to the US but allowing them to go back to India for part of the year. You can also accompany them so they don't get distanced from India and it seems like you have the financial capacity to support that. As for women's rights, it is wrong as it completely depends on the part of India. The main issue is rape and sexual harassment, but women absolutely can have successful careers in India. However, I do think it would be more difficult to convince your wife to move to India than your parents to move to the US, as your wife has a very antagonistic view of India that being in Canada myself, I find quite different from most other Indian diaspora people.

I dunked this in my mocha coffee whick worked. The staff had no problem bringing me a little pot of extra sauce to help with dryness. For for 3 pancakes and toppings, I would have expected more succulent / moist food. It was beautifully presented. Noone asked us how the food was after it arrived, which was slightly telling that maybe people mention the pancakes are dry. My relative was n't able to finish hers due to the dryness.

And why shouldn't staff be paid for having to work unsocialable hours. Unlike the US our culture is work to live not live to work.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world's third-largest population of sheep  behind China and India  but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don't have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems' capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.
The Coalition's usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country's transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.
A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow  ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn't rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?
The battery strategy sets out a ""vision"" over the next decade, in which Australia becomes ""a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition"".
We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers' know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!
The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.
Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated  note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.
Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.
There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.
The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.
The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.
Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.
Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.",0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Rather disappointed today. This is n't the site staff fault by any means, but we booked tickets to watch Napoleon today, via the website.

He needs to be more courtious as he is running a business related to customer satisfaction itself. But after a day of stay, his behaviour was ok. The other staffs are really very gentle and helpful. The rooms are clean. But, all rooms are not of the same standard. So, while choosing ro stay, please personally visit the room and check. I was with my family for 4 days.. 2 days i had, 4 sharing room, both of them very reasonable good. The next two days, parents were there, so they were shifted to double sharing. 1st room was not upto the mark clean and good. But the second one they showed was really nice with good ambience.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good.

Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.
Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.
Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.
The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.
The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.
It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.
The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.
Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it? The ends don't justify the means.",0

While we recognise the likely occurrence of a FOAK premium, where possible, GenCost does not include them for other technologies not yet deployed in Australia and so does not intend to do so for largescale nuclear.

We had a white pizza( essentially cheesy garlic bread), I had salmon fettuccine and partner had a creamy marinara seafood spaghetti. They were well presented and well cooked-for me personally, a little too much lemon used in my dish but by no means made it unpleasant. We also had a couple of glasses of red wine which was really nice. The atmosphere was lively and inviting. As well as eating in, they offer takeaway and there was a steady stream of customers coming in to collect orders in the hour and 30 mins( or so) that we were there, so it obviously a popular spot. Toilets are out the back of the restaurant, which felt a little strange to get to-you go through a door from the main restaurant and into a sort of courtyard where there a lot of restaurant items but the facilities were clean and well kept.

If the numbers have reduced in recent years it's probably because they're being listed on Facebook marketplace instead which doesn't cost you anything and is likely more effective.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday's budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.
Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.
Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.
Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. ""The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,"" Ms King told the Financial Review. ""The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered."" Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those  14 small projects worth about $444 million  were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory's election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money  about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers' third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor's signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money  about $136 million  went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to ""bail out"" Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. ""It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,"" Senator McKenzie said. ""This government spreadsheet has only one colour, and it's a sea of red."" stashes away billions for road and rail project announcements ahead of federal election.",1

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"I am a white male. My country's media, ruling party and women never stop telling me what a horrible person (for being born the way I was) I am and how much they hate me. I am not going to fight and die protecting the interests of people who will laugh and cheer when I come home in a box or as a cripple. 
Here's a video of how women react to a man being mutilated.  . That is what is in women's hearts for you and me. 
When women are forced to die to support the policies they vote for, I'll fight. When the children of the ruling class who hates me fight and die at the same rate as the rest of us, I'll fight. When women come home from the war in boxes at exactly the same rate as men, I'll fight. Until then, if you push a gun into my hands and tell me to kill or be killed, I'll point that gun at you motherfuckers. I'm not dying to protect people who hate me. 
Fuck off. You can't relentlessly insult, degrade, humiliate, accuse, blame and discriminate against people and then expect them to literally die to protect you. Not only would you never protect me but you will celebrate my death. If I'm dead anyway, I'm going to take people who hate me with me to the grave.",0

Likely to return again my only niggle is I wish the service had been a little more attentive post ordering food. We had to wait quite a bit of time for our plates to be cleared after finishing and we not offered any additional drinks until the end of our meal.

Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.
As part of the government's December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the ""core skills occupations list"".
Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as ""targeted for consultation"", rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.
A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was ""bizarre"" given the industry's ""mammoth task"" of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.
In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages ""would be a failure"".
""Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,"" Wawn said on Tuesday.
""Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the'maybe' list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.""
A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O'Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final ""core skills occupations list"".
""Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,"" the spokesperson said.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.
Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.
""\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,"" she said.
""There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.""
Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government's target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.
In December, O'Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but ""we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships"".
However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"There's still lots of money out there being spent and it's pushing up inflation. I work in sales, we distribute composite decking, cladding and screening through trade hardware stores. 
Generally speaking cladding goes on new builds while decking is mostly for the renovations/add on market. Usually the colder months are slow, with cladding holding sales together, while summers the decking really takes off (people are short sighted, they only want to put in decks when it gets warm and realise they don't have one, or their existing one is falling apart). 
We had a bit of a slow start this year, but this month we are getting'summer' level of sales, both in decking and cladding, which is something that none of us really expected. Cladding would make sense because builds happen year round, but people are spending big on renovations as well, which isn't what you'd expect during a cost of living crisis. 
As much as I'd love to say this is because I'm an amazing sales rep, every other state is pushing similar numbers, with sales at 120% of budget coming into the end of financial year. I've got friends that work for our competitors and they are also seeing the same results. There may be a cost of living crisis somewhere, but it sure as shit isn't everywhere, and we expect even more money pumped into the economy come early August as that's bonus/commission season for anyone in sales and corporate, as well as tax return season.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**""
Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.""",1

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.
In my opinion, if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public, you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process: that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation. We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.
If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.
I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.
I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.
Isn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?",0

Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"We need IP and patent laws. There is a reason why India does not produce any breakthrough therapy. If an Indian company invests 1000cr to find a cure they will have to share it with competitor for free. Therefor it is better economic decision to not spend that money and wait for completion to do so or rely on American and EU comps to develop therapy. Pretty much the reason india specific high burdeen infectious diseas therapy lack behind like no new malaria vaccine or antiviral, kala agar, chick guniya etc. forget rare diseases etc. what happens once the pipeline dies off? Even China has now big biotechs focusing on innovation like BieGene etc. 
It is simple game theory that has been analyzed to death. You need patent and IP protection and you need risk takers to recoup money. Weak patent means 0 innovation or just exceptions here and there.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Me and partner visited the Tim Hortons in Golden Square Warrington around today which is a Sunday. It was our first time at this particular Tim Hortons, I've never been to any Tim full stop so this was my first experience. When we arrived it was busy but not rammed, there was a queue for food' collection' which was awkwardly set up as there's not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there's a table in the way of collection also. So that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which I'm adamant does n't work in food places but they keep doing it. They could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some McDonald do but I digress. As we'd never been we used the self serve to figure out what we'd like and the menu were clear and simple, but it was so we could go and order in person as I have a blue light card. The man said Tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal / offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that. The food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer. I got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious. Thanks to the deal, for 2 meals it cost us just under 15. All in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend. The low rating for atmosphere was due to the self serve machines and collection point being where they are, when people were waiting they all seemed a but stressed.

We honestly enjoyed the meal. Detailed review follows: 1. Location: At Boro Nilpur, right on GT road. One can easily find it being widely visible, although not very well lit from outside. 2. Ambience: I wo n't say it was a flashy interior. Having said that, it was decent and clean with air conditioning inside. 3. Hospitality: This was the best thing. Right from the entrance, we were greeted very well. We were the only customers by then, so they took care of all our queries and requests throughout. 4. Food: We ordered Chicken Hariyali Kabab, followed by Tandoori Ruti and Chicken Tikka Masala. The kabab( 6 pieces) was well marinated and it tasted good. The gravy of Chicken Tikka Masala( 6 pieces) blended well with Tandoori Ruti( this was their suggestion, and my father was quite happy with how it tasted). Finally ordered two Virgin Mojito which was very well prepared. I wish the chicken pieces were more tender and juicy for the kabab. 5. Price: Paid a total of 850 for a sumptuous meal for 2. We did enjoy the meal. The price could have been a little cheaper. But the quality is at par with the other restaurants around. 6. Parking: Park the car on the service road before 8 pm when the traffic is high. Overall, not the best, but decently enjoyable.",0

We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n't take long and the restaurant was ' buzzing ', it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n't order again. The gravy was far too thin / watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n't want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n't make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n't fault it.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"I recently visited McDonald for the second time and was pleasantly surprised by the noticeable improvements in their standards. The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, with clean tables and fully stocked stands of cutlery and napkins. One standout aspect was the proactive approach to cleanliness  the staff were in the process of cleaning the toilets, and a notice was placed to indicate this and offer alternative facilities, ensuring customer convenience. Despite being located in the bustling city center of Manchester, the restaurant maintained high standards compared to my last visit in December. The only minor issue was that the order completion stand did not print out a receipt, which could be improved for future visits. Overall, I'm impressed with the positive improvements made by McDonald. It's evident that they're committed to enhancing the customer experience. I especially appreciated the complimentary newspaper available for reading while enjoying my coffee  a nice touch that added to the overall experience. Keep up the good work, McDonald!

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced. Ie building volumes are reducing under labor. At the same time as massive population growth.
The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 
Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 
Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked. Ie 3 years should be long enough to have some influence on building volumes rather than a negative result...

Waited around 20 mins for it so definitely was fresh as it was n't THAT busy when we arrived. Came with 2 lamb chops( great flavour, really well cooked, maybe left on grill a bit longer than i d have preferred), 2 masala fish pieces( some of the best masala fish I ve had, amazing flavour and spices bursting through), 4 chicken tikka botis( great spices and was perfectly cooked-juicy, succulent), 4 wings( again, really well marinated and cooked very well-they were really small wings though), and 2 meat seekh kebabs( piping hot, freshy cooked, flavour unlike any other place I ve had-definitely the best seekh kebab I ve had after Bradfords famous "" sweet centre ""). Cost 18 Got 1 kg lamb karahi with 2 garlic naans. Definitely the best karahi I ve had, served in the karahi itself, gave such a backhome, traditional vibe which probably made it taste even better. Soft meat falling on the bone despite being lamb so hands down! Naans were freshy made, you could tell.. and really tasted the garlic from it. Usually, other places, its a few diced up chunks thrown in the middle but this one tasted INFUSED almost-brilliant. I think it was for the karahi and 3 each for the garlic naan. Unfortunately, the let down was the kabuli pilau. It was lacking that meat flavour in the rice that it should have had. It tasted too plain and sweeter more than savoury due to too many raisins. I tried this first as I knew that sometimes when you start with salty foods, other "" not so salty "" dishes will taste less but was still let down. For 12, it was a big portion, enough for 2 alone or if you having a bit of everything off the menu. We had a jug of mango lassi-really enjoyed it and its the best drink to have between your starters and mains so you can balance out your tastebuds. 8 The deco around the place was vibrant and different, they ve got upstairs seating too. I also believe you could corner off a table and cover the table as parda if needed for your family who wear niqab. The service, I gave 3 stars as it seemed there was only one guy doing everything, serving, taking orders, so we were waiting around longer than usual for basic things such as a refill of water, spoons, tissues etc.( the food makes up for it, the waiting felt worth it!

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste. It's sourced from a small number of places, with a small number of providers. The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.
Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.
The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.
Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.",0

Finally had a shrimp roll. It was pretty good, but had a bit too much mayo for my tastes. This is just a preference thing. I'd be excited to try this place again!",0

With us( 4) there were probably only another 3 kids there. The retro games were on 2 arcade machines. They were tiny though. A modern arcade machine not like the ones in the arcadea when I was young. I'm sure these ones use a lot less power but when 2 people try to play at the same time, you really are squished in close and generally it's hard to play. Some. A good selection of Street Fighter games( sonic boom!) and some other games. I was. Very happy to see joust on one of the machines. Love that game and wasted a lot of my youth playing that. The kids played on the Nintendo Wii but there was no vr to be seen. Maybe it's hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it. The kids fired up the Xbox but it only had 1 controller so they could n't play together which was a shame. A huge selection of board games were available which was ace too.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"I'd read the previous reviews of this establishment and I thought they must be exaggerated. It could n't possibly be as bad as everyone is saying. How wrong I was. The first things you see when you walk in is the dirty floors and tables covered in clutter. The tables that have had the previous customers wrappings removed look sticky and in desperate need of a wipe down. There are 2 self order machines but only one is operational, the other is obviously just for decoration. It is also great for leaning against while in the very long queue to use the lone ordering machine. Once you get to the front of the queue, the machine is n't very intuitive, the menu could be laid out much better. Once your order is entered and paid for, that's when you realise, the machine has no receipt paper so there is no proof you've ordered and you have to memorise your order number. I did n't come here to play memory games, I just want to eat. Another very long wait for the food to be prepared, there is a lot of complaining amongst customers and thus is even before they've tasted the food. But, it is a great place to bond with like minded, hungry people who are getting hungrier by the minute. The staff are very slow and are n't apologetic about it. Over half of them are smoking in the doorway so the remaining few are left to make the orders in a production line. By the time you get your food it is generously fingered by a whole gang of teenagers. Now the food really is something special. All of it room temperature despite being made right in front of us mere seconds ago. The taco, filled with unseasoned, flavourless beef mince at the temperature perfect for happy little bacteria to socialise and have one night stands resulting in pregnancy. Luckily there is a solution to the bland flavourless food. There are plenty of red sachets lying around. The name Fire Sauce fills me with hope. I tear open the packet and eagerly smoother my taco with it. I take a bite... more like Disappointment Sauce. It is barely ketchup. The rest of the food was n't any better and I wo n't be rushing to visit here again although I was rushing somewhere else with stomach cramps not long after eating. Not recommended, it is a shame there are so few Mexican style food establishment around. If that is the kind of food you enjoy, this is not the place to find it.",0

A smackhead once flicked a lit ciggy end in my face, he was walking the opposite way so I turned ran up behind him and only after I closed the distance did I stop my self from punching him in the back of the head, likely breaking my hand and potentially killing him.
I've been in more than a few scraps, but I've rarely ever in my life been just that upset over something. I was pissed off because of having a ciggy flicked at me but that didn't compare to the days maybe even weeks after thinking about how bad that could have been. To do something so stupid. Not only was it terrifying and horrible to think I could have killed him but embarrassing to think that I'd ruin my life and hurt everyone around me over something like that.
That's a moment where I can say I truly grew up and if it had happened years before, as angry and aggressive as I could be towards people who I felt deserved it, I might have made the wrong choice.

But even with the crowds, it's still a really cool place to see. I'd definitely recommend checking out Pulteney Bridge if you're in Bath. It's a great spot for a leisurely stroll and to take in some beautiful views.",0

Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,"Good Food, Disappointing Service Experience "" I recently visited The Kitchen Garden and overall enjoyed the food and ambiance. The dishes were delicious, and the atmosphere was pleasant. However, I encountered a service issue during my visit. One of the staff members, whose name I unfortunately did not catch, exhibited behavior that was less than accommodating. but I found their behavior to be unprofessional and discourteous. Regardless of the circumstances, rudeness from a service provider detracts from the enjoyment of the dining experience. While I appreciate the efforts of most of the staff, one particular waiter behavior did not meet the expected standard of customer service. I believe it's crucial for all staff members to maintain a courteous and welcoming attitude toward customers to ensure a positive experience. I hope the management addresses this concern to maintain the high standard of service the restaurant is known for. Despite this issue, I appreciate the quality of the food and hope that the team can work on ensuring a consistently positive customer service experience for all guests.",0
