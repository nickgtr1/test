Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"OK so a few questions, just to pick apart this fairly insipid response - why aren't any other unions doing this? The AWU don't do it, they instead also get assaulted by the CFMEU.
No other union is this militant, even the ETU. 
Remember when the CFMEU exhibited truly blue collar values by backing domestic violence enthusiast John Setka, in his comments against Rosie Batty? 
Remember how the union rallied behind Setka in reaction to the now-PM seeking his expulsion from the Labor Party?
Setka's VIc branch is already extending into ACT and SA. 
I know for you PINOs, mindless backing of all unions is what you do to avoid being accused of being anti-worker as your politics aren't based on conviction but on status and conformity and inclusion. You can be pro-worker and conclude the CFMEU are a massive problem for Australia. If even parts of the Labor Party are worried about the CFMEU's unhinged militancy, you know there's a problem. What will it take - wives and kids of building firm employees disappearing before people realise that it's an issue?

So many people Ik are on anti depressants because their work gives them bad intrusive thoughts.
Also if you decide to make your own returns, you in a way would take out from their job as less people would be needed in the market so for the same job?

It's also the fact that rugby is not on free to air. There is almost no advertising for it. If you were to be asked who the wallabies are playing coming up, would you be able to answer. 
There is also almost no support for grassroots rugby. The number of smaller clubs that either fold or are forced to amalgamate just to be able to play is also a sad indication of where rugby is at.",1

As I was the only person in the queue, staff really took her time with me, explaining the flavours and allowing me to taste them too. We ended going for two regular scoops(), the pistachio and oreo chocolate cheesecake which was also her favourite too. We also ordered two smaller scoops() of the birthday cake and chocolate, you ca n't go wrong with this really, can you ? Also an Americano, which we added some of the ice cream in, new twist. Great that you have the option of scoop size. There were also options for toppings too. Tasted fresh with amazing flavours, creamy and rich but not too sweet either, just right.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.
Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.
According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.
The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.
On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.
Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.",0

I didn't own the truck obviously. I'm just a guy working towards my truck license. I'm also not a youngster - just decided I'd like to have a truck license since occasionally I've wished I had one.
Honestly, I'd expect someone young to be the most likely to actually have a use for a big truck. They almost certainly don't have enough disposable income have a vehicle like that just because it looks cool. Some people do put cargo in the back of their truck regularly. And those big RAMS can carry a lot more weight than a 2WD Hilux.
I've driven a 2WD hilux fully loaded with a trailer... it was not fun. I had the accelerator pedal on the floor for about an hour and even down hill it only reached 90km/h - the wind resistance alone was more than the tiny motor could handle, let alone the weight which would've been about half a ton in the tray and another ton on the trailer. It was safe, the suspension and brakes could totally handle the weight. But the motor? Fuck me that thing wasn't good enough.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I'll give you a quick breakdown of dating apps in Melbourne; 
-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots
-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.
-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 
- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 
-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 
I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 
My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don't use it to date, it's frowned upon but once you get out there you'll meet people anyway. 
There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 
I am an introvert so it's perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 
I am not single luckily, I wouldn't want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. 
There are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it's so toxic.

The secret weapon was the mysterious and alluring Salsa Verde sauce, served on the side like a daring sidekick ready to take on any culinary challenge! Speaking of challenges, I faced the flat white quest next. It was acceptable, though it lacked a bit of magic. Still, it played well with the avocado toast, so we'll call it a breakfast truce! Now, time to unravel the bagel enigma! The bagel, ceremoniously crowned with a luscious blend of Jam and butter, whispered sweet nothings into my taste receptors. Oh, how it charmed my senses! The space inside the bakery is a cozy hug; think of it as breakfast in a warm embrace! However, if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats, you'll have to roll the dice with the weather. Outdoor seating is a fair-weather friend, but when it cooperates, it's a treat! Attention parents, mini-humans are welcome here! The vibe is kid-friendly, and it's a decent spot to enjoy breakfast with your little ones as long as it's not peak hour madness! To sum it all up, Gail Bakery is like an enchanted breakfast nook that sprinkles a dash of quirkiness into your morning routine. Grab your avocado toast, dance with the Salsa Verda, and embark on a breakfast adventure! Just make sure to check the weather forecast before you set sail to claim the coveted outdoor seats!

If you're into art, Brighton got you covered. There are lots of galleries where you can check out cool paintings and sculptures. You might even find something awesome to take home as a souvenir.

The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. 2. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. 3. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes. The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions were notably small, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent. Overall, while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant, the food quality, particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes, did not meet expectations. The pricing, coupled with the small portions, further detracted from the overall dining experience. I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers.",0

Every religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati. 
>any other scholars come out and speak against their agenda of converting the entire world to one religion
An ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu. 
>But when I knew what holy books of the top 2 religions are teaching, my respect for Hinduism only grew more. 
I can bet you have not read the holy books of the top two religions.

They tasted good, but I'm convinced the vodka was watered down, as my drinks tasted a bit too bearable haha. Mixed feelings about the bar staff, some seemed quite fed up, but others seemed friendly. It was nice to see a range of different people from different backgrounds working in there. A good presence of security and welfare staff throughout the venue made it feel very safe, and the atmosphere was brilliant once it started to get busy.

Google,en-IN,Sarcasm,"A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises. I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.",0

We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.
So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.
The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).
This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.
Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 
It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.
Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 
There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.
So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.",1

The menu has recently had an updated price which I find absolutely ridiculous, you now charge extra for absolutely everything ? In the last few days I had eggs Benedict with extra bacon and you charge for one slice of bacon ? This is unbelievable considering a pack of bacon is about 2. For 2 breakfasts with drinks( you always allowed the speciality hot chocolate onto the added drink but now you do n't allow this ? Even charging me full price for coffee with a syrup) it was 50 for this with 2 smoothies ? Which cost per smoothie even though supplier sells them at each. Previously we could eat a good breakfast in here with 2 decent drinks for just shy of 30( still expensive for Doncaster but we always paid happily due to quality) now I feel this rise in price does n't reflect the current state of people living standards, making the place feel pretentious and only about making more money. The average UK airport full English price is in 2024, yet you are charging in Doncaster, unbelievably ridiculous. We wo n't be coming here anymore.",0

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Another aspect of speech this might change will be around gender.
No one is going to say ""x race need to stop committing crimes"" .. ""x ethnicity need to stop abusing their children"" for fear of falling foul of racial hatred laws.

But every day we hear that ""men need to stop raping women"" .. ""men need to stop abusing women"" to the more extreme ""kill all men"".
Personally I'm offended every time I'm told to stop abusing women because I possess a dick, I'm offended that being masculine has been intertwined with a hateful term ""toxic masculinity"". Would be interesting seeing some ""incels"" take this to court to prevent offense and insult. 
Will these laws finally end the double standard we have around what is ""hate speech"" for race, but ""acceptable commentary"" when it comes to the (male) gender?",1

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Positives: First time going to this place today. Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:",0

No Alcohol onsite allowed. For two people 5 dishes & bowl of coconut rice 106. Will definitely go back. Good experience",0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Was told just after our food arrived using table service that we only had 30 mins, as they were shutting the upstairs where we were seated. Twenty-five mins later, a younger member of staff came over and said we need to leave now. He had also told a number of other customers the same. As me and my friend still had our coffee to finish, I said that we would be on our way, as soon as we had finished. This clearly put him and his teams back up, as they headed over to the corner area we were seated and began picking up stools to very heavy handedly dropping them on the tables. The team began to make comments amongst themselves about getting the job done. After a few more mins, we were ready to leave and as we did, I was issued a few very sarcastic have a good evenings by the team. At the bottom of the stairs was the manager, who said they'd just dealt with a technical issue and very confusingly said that was why upstairs was shut, but it was all sorted now. I did mention to him about the rudeness of a few of his staff. Before we left, my friend placed a large takeaway order for both our families at home, only to get home with the said order and a number of food items missing. Needless to say, I wo n't be heading into that store again!",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Seems to be an historic building well sited in busy Leamington. Reception guy was very polite, no problems checking in( 1 night only) We paid a little more for a better room, typically as with the age of the building the bedroom had high ceiling, very spacious, with settee and chairs, 40 in tv, tea / coffee etc. Very clean, so too was the bathroom. No safe in the room, no a big deal. Wifi was quite strong too. Had evening meal in nearby restaurant, breakfast good. Parking is a pain, the Angel only has room in their courtyard for about 20 cars at 12 / night! First come gets a slot, no reservations.! Got here early and was okay, parking in the streets nearby is nearly impossible, gets better after office hours. All in all I give it, its just lacking a bit of buzz, needs livening up. But would recommend and visit again.",0
