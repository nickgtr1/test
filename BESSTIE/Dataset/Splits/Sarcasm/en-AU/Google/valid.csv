Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Looks cool, staff are fun and efficient, and most importantly the food was delicious. Had a ln early dinner of the tapas and fried chicken burger. Tapas had the best corn fritters I can remember, tasty salmon on fried wontons, meat balls with cumin( yum), and some sticky pork belly. Fried chicken burger had crunchy tenderloins and was good and tasty! Only advice would be to get those chips crunchier Coffee( I had two) chai, and iced chocolate were also of a high standard. Great cafe for the town.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Chicken recipes are nice and decent quality. They have a larger menu than the usual Broaster does, such as wingettes in different flavours. Chicken is definitely genuinely halal. The only issues are that customer service can be average at times due to communication barriers. Can be noisy if dining in, sometimes parking is difficult to find. Other than those, I'm sure you will enjoy their chicken.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Authentic Thai. Place was relatively clean and well presented. We ordered a variety of meals and they came out in a timely fashion. One thing I would have to pick on is their attention to detail, as we asked for a very mild curry but got a very hot curry instead. And asked for coconut rice but was given normal jasmine rice, which they did rectify. Service was ok and the food was great in taste. Not badly priced either.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The pies are pretty good, but the Banh Mi rolls are even better.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Very enjoyable experience, however the current exhibition is a bit plain and low effort. Previously they have had much more interesting one afor the kids, like Lego car racing( with lots of big drops) or massive foam blocks from kids to build / climb with. Still, has lots of great modern art and a clay creation area.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to. Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance ",1
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Tried this place because it came recommended by my parents. I enjoyed the Chicken 65 buriyani. The Chicken 65 was soo tasty. Everything was tasty it sure cleared my sinuses with the right amount of spices. I really liked the appetiser of the Puri filled tamarind chutney and yogurt. Soo good. Enjoyed saag paneer and did n't really have time goat curry as the buriyani was enough. I got that for my aunt. Loved the roti and naans even if a bit over priced. The food is definitely tasty and nice. However a bit pricey. I always think Indian food is pricey. But I could have ordered only 1 buriyani. I downloaded the app to get reward points and 5 off. My bill was still I did take all the leftovers home. Waiters were very nice and food came out fast. So sad there was n't tea left to order.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Very nice atmosphere with amazing ambient lighting. Service was slightly slow but this was due to the amount of customers at the time. Workers were kind and play area is large for kids with a clean look overall.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Different and fun. Very nice food, but on the spicier side of things. The mild options are good alternative for those who do not like spicy food. Staff is very helpful, patient, and explain the menu very well. Lovely decor, super spacious and comfortable seating options. Live music is an option from pm onwards. It great alternative for functions. You never know until you try I gave it 4 stars because the napkins could be a lot better.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"always good to still have this around-and i think the automated ordering machines did help clear up the queues you used to get a lot of. you ca n't really expect much-it's like most other McDonalds. but again, always handy to have this near you for that quick easy bite.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,I used to love this shop but the fish I got was so thin and was very dry.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The staff were great. Funny, friendly, relaxed. We came in to enquire about a show and when we came back they remember what we wanted. They were very nice to the grandchild we had with us. The theatre is a little hard to find being upstairs and entry through a little gate. There are a few theatres here, 4 or 5 I think so they can shake multiple shows. 3 hours parking outside although that can be very crowded sure to ask them other shops. A credit too Batemans Bay",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,The only thing worth seeing in Muswellbrook. Even better if you get a nice sunny day. Somewhat disappointing that it is n't a real dog but a statue of one...,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Ooooft this pizza is actually very good considering it's in Benalla. A great choice if you feel like a fat night in or a good hangover cure. There's the typical non Italian pizza options but the flavours make up for that. Definitely a good pizza place for a no frills treat.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"We visited Griffith in early Jan so a lot of restaurants were closed. Happy that this one was open as we really enjoyed our meal. Service was attentive and helpful. We had a couple of jumbo pizzas, salad and chips which was plenty for the 5 of us. Good that they do half half pizzas too so we could try a wider range. Kids had Margherita and Hawaiian, adults had a couple of the veggie pizza toppings. Thin and crispy style with not too much toppings and cheese, which is how we prefer our pizzas. Big servings and reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend this place although I know there are many other pizza options in the area which we have not tried.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,A nice little subway located in the Karratha shopping centre. The sandwich was pretty good. The price was not hugely different to ones in Perth.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"If you looking for something lively than this the place. They serve good food and the view is just amazing it can be couple, friends or family gatherings this place is good to experience. I love their pizza, I went on new year eve saw the mesmerising fireworks and enjoyed the liveliness. I would recommend this place.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Great little pub affordable prices on beverages,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Buckley Street Pizza and Burgers Is a great place to grab a feed! The Pizza base in my opinion is unique in the sense that it's like a deep dish with a really nice crispy crust and a light soft dough, the toppings were nice as well. The Cowboy Burger was also a really nice Burger! It comes with a side of Chips The Chips were beautifully golden and crispy, I could n't fault them at all! If you are in the area and trying to decide what to get for dinner ? I Highly Recommend giving Buckley Street Pizza and Burgers a crack!",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The coffee is exceptional here. Like next level. Beautiful flavour, expertly made, and very nicely presented. It an all round winner that emphatically underscores the view that you can get great coffee in regional areas. Nice egg and bacon roll here. A generous size with a good amount of egg and bacon. The tomato relish was a little too sweet for me though and it was so liberally applied that it oozed out the side of the roll with the slightest pressure. The chicken and pesto roll thingy was a tiny bit disappointing for me-I found it a bit bland and over complicated-but not so for my partner who enjoyed it. It not cheap here but it all good quality. The cafe is small and it nicely and fashionably set out in the urban hipster style with some good tables on the street. It was doing a very brisk takeaway trade while we were here and plenty of people were on the outside tables too. The staff were young and friendly and doing a good job in an amiable way. It a good place. Coffee is taken ultra seriously here and it a highlight. Most city places do n't make coffee this good.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Great food. Great staff. We were tucked out the back in a very bland room. We were there for our sons 17th birthday. Everyone had received their meal and finished it before my sons pizza was brought out. Little disappointed they forgot his meal. We appreciated the staffs assistance by not charging us for the pizza they forgot.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Tasty, hot and fresh bakery like the name suggests it is hot bake. We tried chicken & veggie pie and butter chicken pie. The chicken & veggie was flavorful and the butter chicken pie was literally butter chicken curry in a pie. Must try if you around.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Must be a busted sewerage pipe on the premises or something because the whole place reeks of faeces. Not the best environment for a satisfactory customer experience when you have the smell of excrement in your nostrils. Been like this for a while.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Cute small bakery. All the items look very beautiful and delicate. I did n't get to try the cake this time, but all the flavor profiles are interesting and appetiting which justifies their higher price. There is no sitting area, except two benches outside. It serves as a great photo corner though.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"This cafe had polite staff but disappointed they did n't offer a proper loose tea chai, or a sticky chai. My chai was the powder chai tea, tasted over sweet, and was n't the special treat of having a properly made infused tea. This is becoming more in demand so a good loose leaf chai infused in a pot separates the good baristas from the ordinary. I would not have ordered the chai if I had known. I did question when ordering, but I do nt think the guy knew anything about chai tea. We were a bit bit lost in translation. There's a couple of outdoor tables with umbrellas at the end of the mall and car park. Someone had a glutenfree date and walnut slice, it was n't vegan but they enjoyed it.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Sports bar had the distinctive odour from the men toilets, 3rd world quality amenities, staff in the Bistro were attentive, bar staff, including the manager on duty, more interested in their phones, 4 people walked out awaiting service that never eventuated whilst we were on the premises.",1
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Stopped here for dinner-was a good pub meal. We shared a schnitzel which was large but thin, garlic prawn sauce was in a bucket but you needed it. Pork belly bites were ok but needed some pickles / salad to help cut through the richness. Also got a kids fish & chips which only had 1 small piece of fish-came out quick but for 15 thought perhaps you would get more. Had lots of good options on the menu, would come again",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"We have ordered idli Samber, masala dosa, mysore masala dosa and Gulab jamun.. idly and Gulab jamun was ok.. dosa was not good at all. This restaurant name is based on dosa.. very disappointed maysore masala dasa was so so sweet.. not recommend.",1
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"We stayed at the Bowral Hotel for a couple nights recently for a friend wedding. Location was perfect-lots of great cafes nearby. Room was newly renovated, clean and tidy. We did n't plan to be there much so it was perfect place to shower and sleep. Service was welcoming when we checked in but did n't have any other interaction with any staff the rest of our time there. Only thing we would recommend they sort out is the door to access the rooms on top of the hotel-every time it's opened it slams shut loudly.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,The staff are lovely & the food is pretty consistent. I just wish the ao could be more accurate about delivery times. There needs to be some sort of warning on super busy nights so when you select the location you get a warning that tells you that your wait will be longer than usual due to them being busy. This way you could decide if you want to wait or if you will go somewhere else.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Ordered a Mini Value range pizza for collection. Staff were happy to' custom make "" it without a couple of ingredients, as I requested. When I entered the store the staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, plus their usual customer-facing screen that shows yr order & what stage it's at was offline, so I had no idea if it was made or not. Eventually, after serving another collecting customer( & not speaking to or looking at me before or during that interaction) they' found' my order, which had been sitting on a warming plate for the whole time I waited. If they were so short staffed they had to make pizzas rather than serve, a simple' sorry we'll be right with you' wld have gone a long way, instead of making me feel like I was invisible. Luckily, the pizza was delicious.",1
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I was in Cairns for the Anzac Day long weekend. I attended for a late lunch and ordered fish and chips. The fish and salad were excellent, but the chips were well below par. I was born in the UK, and if I order fish and chips, I expect man chips, not farting little overdone French fries. The French fries were offered on the plate in a tiny, pathetic cardboard boat. Not enough!! The presentation was ok, but I left the restaurant wanting to find a traditional seaside fish and chippy that sold authentic chips. The fish was nice. Sorry but this is only my opinion. Others may not agree.",0

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"BCC Cinema is in a very convenient place in Sunshine Plaza Maroochydore. The venue was nice, and cosy seating, sound system was good, and refreshments were available to purchase just by the ticket purchasing area. But only thing the parking should be free for the Cinema customer until the Cinema finishes time but we had to pay on the exit which surprised us.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,There is one heated pool and one other pool that is for laps there both inside and one more outside that is massive but cold( in a good way) the food and drinks are expensive but there is a gym too that open but you have to pay.

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"One of my favorite sushi, I love the tempura products, but I do n't recommend the Vietnamese spring rolls. There is also a small disadvantage that there is too much rice in suchi the closing time is too early, every time I want to go after work, but it is closed. Just visit Again , sushi still as good as how it was. but the hot snack was really disappointed. the mushroom i can only taste the taste of the oil. it make me feel. the vege croquette and the squid stick is taste like full of flour. The oysters is taste really fishly. Donot recommend.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Been to this Macca a few times recently. Chips have been cold on more than one occasion, floor is very dirty with rubbish. As for the customer service  it seems that basic manners and customer service skills do n't exist anymore. No acknowledgement from staff, not even a simple smile at any point and no eye contact when giving you your order. It Macca after all but it would be nice for staff to work on their RBF and treat customers like the ' valued customer ' name printed on the order ticket. You have to change the name of Happy Meals if staff keep up this attitude.",1
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Great screen quality but the cinemas themselves were filthy and looks like the theatre was not cleaned between sessions. Had to brush a handful of popcorn and move a drink off my seat. Also no recliners in the Xtremescreen theatre despite the ticket cost.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Really disappointed. Have been craving for a while. Dined in, ordered mini bowl, spicy beef. Was not spicy. No lettuce. Ordered 300ml drinks, were given and paid for 600ml, were n't able to exchange as employee had cracked the lids on the bottles. So disappointed as I craved this takeaway. Will not go back",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"It a nice place to have breakfast and lunch. The only reason I gave 4 stars only is because the cappuccino chocolate topping is too sweet, which is not commonly used in cafes, my partner only took 1 sip n gave up. As a sweet-tooth, I also find it way too sweet, it also has a caramel flavour.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"I had breakfast from this place during a trip and it was really good, which was served by a very friendly staff.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Great cafe! This place gets very busy. The staff were friendly and welcoming. We ordered a Single Royale with Sweet Potato Fries and Chilli Eggs with a Hash Brown Brekky. The coffees were great! Highly recommended!,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Fish was really oily and was supposed to be fried but looks like it was that oily it looked grilled was not crunchy at all. Chips were stale or overcooked was tough to eat. The potato cakes were n't the worst but the only good thing was the south Melbourne dimsim. Honestly worst fish and chips I have personally eaten,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,This place used to do amazing Afghan naan. But now the quality and weight of naan has dropped. Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,1
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The staff here are a real standout! They're friendly and hospitable. The atmosphere is cosy. Both the drink and food menu have a great variety. There is a large selection of desserts, all of which have been delicious when I've tried them. The tiramasu is especially good. And you must n't leave without the almond cookies. The food is presented very well, and the portions are perfect. We have tried a variety of dishes over the years. The prawn and caesar salad are particularly good. The pork options have been nice, too. The pizza toppings are great, and there are heaps of flavours. It would be even better if they were woodfire! Pricing is a little higher, but you kinda expect it, considering it's the only Italian place in town and popular. It's in a great location too.",0

The app is a great addition to the experience. Cheap beer in the bar below. Of course it not 5 star hotel quality of cleanliness, but you get what you pay for. Only downside to me is the clientele can be loud at night  lotsa young party people. But if that your vibe or it does n't bother you, I recommend staying here.",0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The food was amazing, enjoyed every bit of it.. but could n't finish all. Had to take it away. Staff was amazing.

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,What a Gem. On recommendation from friends went there for a Mother Day lunch with the fam. Fresh and tasty with flavor and spice to send your tastebuds zinging. Great size servings and complexity of flavor and texture in every dish ordered. A freshly squeezed sugarcain juice to soothe the delicious spicy punch. I could imagine a splash of white rum in that would be dang fine. A decent atmosphere in an unexpected place. It's on the return list for sure,0

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Surreal is an excellent restaurant and the food is superb and service is efficient however on my third visit in Autumn the room was very cold to the point of having to leave a scarf and jacket on. Two small RC with only one turned on is not going to heat a former church chapel and a projector screen slide of an open fire really does n't cut it. Unless the heating is improved it not the place to visit in Autumn and Winter unfortunately.,1

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,This dish in the picture is a large Spaghetti Bolognese and it was certainly a large portion as my wife had the regular and the difference in size is very noticeable. The quality of food was very good but not the best and delivered to our table in good time. We also had a Garlic Bread starter( no photo) and that was very nice too. The service was polite and friendly with zero faults there however the restaurant is in need of a revamp as it's a dull and dated which does n't help the atmosphere. We will definitely be going back again to try some of the seafood dishes they have on offer too.,0
Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Pretty dissapointed in the food quality. Purchased a plain pie and sausage roll. Plain pie had no flavour, so bland. All I could taste was the pastry.

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,Been to this place several times. Heaps of room with even area for a party hall. Their service is good and quick. Wait time is less. Tables are placed at a good distance so everyone has a good level of privacy. Best to make reservations if going in a group. They have a kids play area to keep the young ones busy but sitting in that area can be noisy. Food was beautifully presented but taste would be a 4 on 5 for me as I have had better. Their silken tofu was not up to the mark. I would still go here to have Thai food,0

Google,en-AU,Sarcasm,"We recently stayed at the Adina and I have to say we were thoroughly disappointed with the room we were allocated. The hotel was fully booked and I feel as though the room we were given should n't of been offered to guests. It smelled like dank, musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home, there was visible dust on the TV cabinet, and on the first night, our air conditioner did n't work. The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.

The irony of someone associated saying this without some degree of analytical backup is hilarious; folks looking for their first home would probably agree, those renting/looking for the next one would also agree (aka the demographic that has been ignored for the last few decades), those who just bought a home and getting hit with the reality of ""sometimes rates go up"" would agree, however those either fully paid off mortgage wise, or majority paid off I struggle to believe have the same sentiment as they would be pushing for their investment to drop in value.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"Hypothetical situation:
Someone is born overseas and arrives with his parents when  he is 3 years old. He attends school through to grade 12. Later on he gets mixed up with the ""wrong crowd"" and is jailed for several years - let's say it was armed robbery. He has never left Australia - too poor to consider travelling.
At the end of his prison sentence, he is deported because he never became an Australian citizen.
In my view, he is Australian, he has no ties to that foreign country, can't even speak the language well. He has no family left in that country.
Should he be deported? Sure he's not a nice bloke, but isn't he Australia's problem?
This is the reason we should, and indeed always have in previous directions, consider ties to Australia before deporting them.
This isn't being soft as a society. This is taking responsibility for the people we brought up. Also, what happened to do the crime, do the time?

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. ""If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.""",0

I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least 72 hours in advance. The only exception was if  someone called in sick.

Reddit,en-AU,Sarcasm,"This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 
Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).

I know there aren't quick fixes on supply and a lot of it is State problems, but if you mean to tell me Albo couldn't be using the bully pulpit to encourage vacancy taxes, Airbnb crackdowns, threats of GST allocations linked to housing supply and capping immigration numbers to 2-people-per-new-home-builtd-the-year-prior you're kidding yourself.
I know theres plenty of pressure from the development lobby and others to not do any of this, but at what point does your desire for political survival trump pleasing your corporate overlords?

Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3.

I will definitely try their pizza next time. The price can be a bit much depending on the size of pizza. The place is good, with good parking space but there is not a lot of seating space.

They've got some props and also a zebra coloured scooter for photobooth. For all you photogenic people do n't miss to get your selfies and come up with different poses. Coming to what I had here. 1. Flavoured Margarita: I liked this moctail which I felt it had the taste of the strawberry. It was really refreshing. 2.

Reddit,en-IN,Sarcasm,"My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. 
One time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. 
He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. 
Some people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.  
You forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Having had burgers and fries in various continents and brands such as McDonalds, Shake Shack, 5Guys, CaliBurger, Triple O and Burger King, I have to say this branch even though smaller, has minimal seats cooks a good burger and especially proper potatoe fries freshly made unlike a competitor with golden arches that consistently serves soggy, warm, over salted, processed fries. You can learn a lot from Burger King with properly cooked meals golden arches. Also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature. As with many mainstream burger chains and franchises I find the burgers not served up to 71c cooking temperature. Its always warm and there seems, in the UK no Food and Safety, like the US to require cooking and serving your burger hot at Burger King seriously fix your app. Heck contact me and I'll work with you on it.",0

After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station.

But I'll get to that at the end. Sunset Burger: Absolutely lovely, and tasty. Around on its own I believe, and then instead of going for the sides we opted for the loaded fries as another dish instead. The burger as a stand alone item would be. Loaded fries: Do n't get fooled by advertisement. It was 8, and I tasted 5 too much. Firstly the loaded element, which was hard to find any chicken it claimed to have in, I think I counted around 3 strands. And then alot of the loaded, is very central, so you feel there is no flavour else where. The main issue is the flavour / taste, the only way to describe it, is it tasted like the old mini oven pizzas I used to have when I was younger. The taste was identical to that pizza, which was so odd to have that cheap oven pizza taste on chips. It did n't have any unique flavours, or any spice. We had to drown it in hot sauce, to then get Hot Oven Pizza flavour. Honestly I would n't recommend it at all, it's not worth disappointing yourself for 8.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",0

Quite a nice view of London from the window too. Did n't have breakfast but Premier Inn breakfast is usually pretty good. Docking a star as the water in the sink was draining very slowly, and I found a pill( ? ? ?) on the floor, which is obviously quite the health and safety risk for people travelling with young children.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"First time trying Uyghur food, overall very delicious mains and great value for money. Lambtugur dumplings: delicious, dough is thicker than other Asian dumplings I had, almost similar to a pelmeni. The meat is well seasoned and goes well with the vinegary chilli oil Diced Leghmen: was intrigued by the idea of diced noodles and it definitely delivered. There was a great crunch from the veg, the sauce was spicy, numbing and a little funky which was delicious. Kept having more! Etles spicy trotters: the sauce on this is truly exceptional, I personally love the texture of trotters so I really enjoyed this dish, maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n't like the texture( but still loved the sauce). Honey cake: dense and oddly cold, was n't the best honey cake I had. If I were to come to Etles again I stick to the mains! The staff is friendly, food comes out quick, overall great value for money with large portion sizes. Enjoyed it!",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Awesome food with some great varieties, Impressed by the portion size. Massive portions for the mains. We took, Rajastani Daal and Dill and Spinach Chicken. It was deliciously tasty. We took Aloo Tikki chat-Bigger portion could have been a good idea there and would have preferred a flat presentation rather than the small bowl, which was difficult to eat. Service was good. Especially enjoyed the special request they fulfilled for Pickle and Onion to go with the food. Surprised to see it was charged though when we saw the bill. Would certainly recommend for the great tasting food and big portion sizes overall.",0

Staff were very attentive and took our order at the table, bringing our drinks over. I ordered the Bombay Fried Chicken Burger-Buttermilk fried chicken with mature cheddar, mango chutney, curry mayo, crispy onions, tomato and lettuce. Delicious with a bit of a kick. Then for dessert I had White Chocolate & Vanilla Cheesecake with berry compote and maple mascarpone. What looked a small portion was just right, and not overly sweet. Liked that we could all pay separately at the till when we had finished our meal. Was n't overly busy for a Thursday evening, but nice we could all chat without having to shout over loud music.",0

Disappointed, I hate giving reviews but there is no complaint email for Papa John, so.",0

Be aware that you pay when you order and they ask up front for a tip even before you are served.",0

This helped to make the evening a bit more fun and enjoyable. Our film was on screen 3, I think it was. It was fine, the screen was large and sound was good. We sat towards the back in the middle, so viewing angles were great. The negative, though, were the seats, which were a little uncomfortable, especially as it got toward the end of the film. Because of this, I've removed a star. Overall, I'd recommend coming here, and we will be heading back for sure.",0
Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,First time going here and as soon as you walk though the door you can smell the desserts which was nice and the atmosphere was lovely too. There were a few of us so had to wait a couple of minutes while they set some tables up. The staff were really friendly and the desserts that we ordered all looked amazing.

I was waiting for an order and it was taking a while however Manali made sure I was felt comfortable and welcome and gave me a free drink whilst my order was being made.

The interior is very smart and well maintained. The bar staff are pretty friendly and attentive. The bar offers a good range of decent ales and lager. You wo n't find the lower tier Australian and American lagers served here. The food menu is simple and straightforward as expected of a small kitchen. The burgers in particular are well made here. At the rear of the premises is a very nice out door / beer garden area, which is often heaving in the summer. Most Saturday nights you can expect to see a live band preform and this often draw quite a throng so be aware of if you are planning quiet Saturday night drink.",0

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"Food was lovely, however I would not recommend if you are vegetarian. They served my vegetarian partner a meat samosa instead of a vegetable samosa, he took a bite and was rather upset.

We were given 10 % off of the bill but that did not make up for the lack of customer service and apology.",0

Eventually we had 2 lanes sorted out and a thoroughly enjoyable time! Car parking is easy with a number of facilities in the area, payment for parking is best through an app we have discovered. It also free after 1600 in the carpark we chose. The bowling centre is located on the second floor of the building, there are stairs available as well as a lift should you need it. Inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks, quite a few arcade games are also available; some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes. The bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to 6 people per lane, we had 2 lanes next to each other for our group. Military discount is available making it around 8 per game, table service from the bar can be achieved by scanning a QR code from the small table at your lane.

Google,en-UK,Sarcasm,"The food is great, huge portions, very tasty, pretty cheap. I've always had good service when I went, but it is more like a cafe that serves big meals than a restaurant, so it's a different style of service. I would probably go here more often if they took card, as I rarely have cash on me. They also do n't have an alcohol licence, which makes perfect sense for the size and style of the place.

The English muffin with the chicken liver parfait was unbelievably good, but very small. The cassoulet with the cod lacked flavour sadly and the crumb was quite wet, but the fish was cooked well.

The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite.

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"The last Gov report showed the cost to the UK of reoffending was around 18 billion a year. 
The same statistics put the cost of housing a prisoner each year somewhere around 50k.
In the UK currently we have 95k people in prison.
Let's say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.
People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can't. It's not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.
The whole myth around increased punishment isn't a deterrent argument falls apart as well when scrutinised. How many of you would walk down the streets in the UK and smoke a joint? - Not worried about it right.. - Now how many of you would do the same in Singapore or Dubai? - Not so willing to are you, why? - Because you are shit scared of the consequences there, don't nobody want to go to a Dubai Jail.

Having a national holiday (aside from being a great opportunity to get pissed) fosters a sense of collective belonging. It is a net positive that helps heal divisions and motivates a feeling that your community has a collective power (to fix shit).

Reddit,en-UK,Sarcasm,"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.",0
