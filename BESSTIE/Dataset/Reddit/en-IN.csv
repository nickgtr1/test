india,Something just happened with my Domino’s order during Durga Puja and I don’t know what to do,"I’m honestly still shaking a bit while typing this. I didn’t expect something like this would happen.

I ordered some chicken pizza and other stuff from Domino’s around 1:50 AM. I thought ordering that late would avoid any problem since most people would be resting. But on the road that leads to my house, there’s a pandal. Some hooligans were there, drinking, and they stopped the delivery guy. They told him if I want the order, I have to come there and take it myself.

I didn’t want to get into any confrontation at that hour, so I told the delivery boy just to give it to them or take it back. I also said I don’t want any refund, just don’t share my details with them. Later he called me from his personal number and explained again. He said he didn’t tell them my address and that if he had known another route, he would have avoided that road.

What’s stressing me out is…

They actually took the food. I keep thinking maybe they forced him to tell them my details. He told me he didn’t, but I can’t stop worrying.

The delivery boy is Muslim, and I was scared if they threatened him or worse. He said nothing serious happened, but still I feel bad.

I’m not a complete outsider here, but I’m not deeply local either, so I’m scared this might create problems later.


Normally, I don’t care what people think about me. I’ve had people give me looks before for what I do or eat, and I never bothered. But this felt different. I didn’t expect to be caught up in something like this just for ordering food.

I don’t know what to do now. Do you think they might have found out where I live? If they confront me later, how should I handle it? And if this happened to you, how would you deal with it?

I don’t mind if replies are late. I just want to know what others think about this, because right now I’m honestly stressed and unsure.",0.88,745,0,745,en-IN
india,Why is blasting bhajans at 2AM and 5AM so normalised?,"Bruh these pandal pooja people have officially lost their damn minds. Who the hell thought it was a good idea to BLAST bhajans till 2 am, then fire it back again at 5 in the morning?! Yesterday i slept late around 2 and usually their music keeps playing till 2 and then i accidently woke up at 5 and boom they'll start again on full volume. Like it felt soo annoying and sadly no one can even do anything about it and they keep repeating it every day

And don’t even come at me with that “devotion” excuse. Half of these jokers aren’t devotees, they’re just a bunch of chapri awaara clowns who treat pandals like a free DJ party and just want to make noise. Forget “bhakti” the same dudes playing bhajans will shamelessly drink and smoke in the mean time and blast vulgar item songs during arrival and visarjan of Durga maa or Ganesh ji

It’s not spirituality, it’s just a noise pollution competition. I swear no one can even connect to God even if they wanted to cuz it's not even close to being peaceful it's just pure noise at this point which really needs to be stopped.",0.87,234,0,234,en-IN

india,People are openly admitting their leaders are “evil” but still supporting them – religion over development.,"I saw a video where a cow refused to eat from Amit Shah. The caption said that cows can sense evil and do not eat from such people.

What shocked me more than the video was a comment below it. Someone wrote, “Who said Amit Shah is not a evil? I am a BJP supporter. And I know what he has done in past. But I still support him, we just need a person who can protect our country and religion.”

Reading this honestly scared me. The person himself admits that Amit Shah is evil, he knows about the wrong things in the past, but still supports him. And the only reason is religion.

This shows how far blind loyalty has gone in our politics. People do not care about jobs, education, healthcare, the economy or corruption anymore. They do not question their leaders. They just want someone who speaks about religion and they are ready to support him no matter what he has done.

It feels like the priorities have completely changed. People are not asking for governance, not asking for progress, not even thinking about a better future. All that matters now is religion and identity politics. And the sad part is, this is not just one person, there are thousands who think in the same way.

I am honestly very worried about how extreme this loyalty has become. When people themselves admit their leaders are evil but still say they will support them no matter what, then what kind of democracy can we even expect? How can a democracy function in such a situation? How can we hope for better governance when development is no longer the priority and everything is only about religion and identity politics?

Are we stuck in a future where people will always put religion above everything else, even the country’s growth and well being?

India's 2025 stampedes reveal a brutal reality: negligence is routine. Overcrowding, shoddy planning, and absent civic responsibility transform celebrations into catastrophes.

Until authorities and citizens prioritize accountability and safety, preventable deaths will pile up, and excuses will mean nothing. Act now, or mourn later.

I received some messages in dm last time, and some people offered me some help. Some people donated, some got me some clothes, some food etc. One guy offered me help with a place to stay for few days, but I got really sick for 4 days and wasn't able to come, and the guy got really upset. Tried to get some help via one lawyer, but the guy was not competent too much in matters like this. 

But I appreciate greatly help of yall, who offered it from the heart. 

My apologies if I wasn't able to reply because of some reason. 

I am personally not having anything against having a lawyer.  But this time it was really uneventful. I couldn't get much help. 

So basically rn situation is the same. Im still at the airport waiting room. Same shit more or less, and still need some help to reach your government people, who could possibly influence FRRO and ask my embassy to help. More than anything I still need a place to stay. Im so tired of staying here. There was only 1 real offer with hosting that time, but i couldn't come (got sick) and the guy got upset. 

I still need a place to stay. If someone can host, please kindly dm me. 

Here I have recorded a video of me, speaking from the airport.

Here are some documents. (I uploaded them unblurred first, but just after 1 hour some mf tried to find and hack my Facebook account based on my name and surname so I'm not doing this again. Whoever is really desiring to help with legal issues - just write me and I will try to reply as soon as I can. Thank you all in advance.

 Turning 180 m² of municipal land in Barpeta into a zero-maintenance mini orchard/flower patch
I got 78 saplings (Assam Lemon, Kagji Lemon, Bokul, Hollock, Arjun, 10 Gulmohar, 3 Mango) for just ₹561, all native or hardy species. The field is ~180 m² (like 70% of a tennis court).
Plan is simple:
Dig soil depressions around each sapling to catch rainwater.
Let the hardy trees mostly fend for themselves.
Zero daily watering, minimal effort.
By year 4:
Lemons and Bokul will be green and possibly fruiting.
Gulmohar will add some flashy flowers.
Mango? Maybe 1 survives lol.
Total carbon sequestered? ~1.8 tonnes CO₂.
The field will basically become a tiny oasis of greenery, flowers, and some fruit in the middle of Barpeta. 
Anyone here tried urban guerrilla planting with minimal maintenance?
Tips to increase survival rates without daily watering?
Might also take this to the municipal board for permission—imagine getting a legit zero-maintenance park section approved.
how realistic is this and anyway i could maybe water them for free? I'm a still a kid after all and would i get permission?

I'm the founder of a startup in its early stages called Ad on Head, and I'm looking for some crucial feedback from the experts in this community.
What is Ad on Head?
We are building a hyperlocal, moving ad network. We equip delivery and bike-taxi riders with smart helmets that have a digital display on the back. These displays show geo-targeted ads for brands as the riders move through high-traffic areas of a city. Essentially, we're turning a fleet of riders into a dynamic, real-world billboard network.
Why I'm asking for help:
Before we go all-in on our go-to-market strategy, I want to validate the idea with the people who would actually use it – brand and marketing decision-makers. Your real-world perspective is incredibly valuable and would help us build something that brands actually want.
Who I'm hoping to connect with:
If you are a CMO, Head of Marketing, Brand Manager, Growth Marketer, or anyone in a similar role at a D2C or B2C brand, your insights would be gold. Especially if you have experience with OOH (Out-of-Home), digital, or location-based advertising.
The Ask:
I'm looking for a brief, no-strings-attached 15-minute call. I won't sell you anything. I just want to:
Get your honest first impression of the concept.
Understand your potential concerns.
Hear what kind of analytics or ROI you'd need to see to consider a platform like ours.
Any feedback, positive or critical, would be immensely helpful.
If you're open to a quick chat and sharing your expertise, please comment below or shoot me a DM.

india,Ola Electric’s Service Network In India Is A Complete Disaster: 118 Out Of 135 Cities Have Zero Available Service Slots,"I’m absolutely FURIOUS. I’ve been digging into Ola Electric’s “service network” in India, and what I found is a complete disaster. Out of 135 cities I checked, 118 have ZERO available service slots. Their centers are basically empty shells, yet Ola continues to list them as “operational” on their app and website. People trying to book services are met with nothing for weeks or even months. Cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Bhuj, Daman, Diu, and many more are completely affected.

Ola sells these scooters with fancy marketing hype about “revolutionizing mobility,” but after purchase, getting support is nearly impossible.

There is no proper after-sales network, spare parts are scarce, and customer service treats you like you’re bothering them. Customers are left stranded with broken scooters, waiting endlessly for basic maintenance or repairs. This isn’t just bad business; it’s reckless and irresponsible. The company takes advantage of government subsidies and expansion hype while failing miserably to service the very products they sell.

For those who want specifics, here’s the list of cities in Gujarat where Ola’s service centers are essentially useless: Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Jamnagar, Gandhinagar, Nadiad, Surendranagar, Bharuch, Vapi, Veraval, Porbandar, Godhra, Bhuj, Anand, Gandhidham, Palanpur, Valsad, Navsari, Botad, Amreli, Dwarka, Ankleshwar, Kalol, Dahod, Rajpipla, Mahuva, Modasa, Himmatnagar, Idar, Vyara, Wadhwan, Una, Palitana, Mandvi, Thangadh, Viramgam, Lunawada, Khambhat, Daman, Diu, Mangrol, Babra, Kadi, Visnagar, Mansa, Petlad, Kapadvanj, Wadi, Padra, Dabhoi, Savli, Kheda, Tarapur, Karjan, Dholka, Dhandhuka, Limbdi, Dhrangadhra, Chotila, Dasada, Halvad, Lakhtar, Rapar, Bhachau, Nakhatrana, Mundra, Adipur, Anjar, Bhimasar, Dhrol, Kalyanpur, Okha, Khambhalia, Sikka, Jamkhambhaliya, Lalpur, Bhanvad, Ranavav, Kutiyana, Miyani, Sutrapada, Kodinar, Talala, Visavadar, Maliya, Vanthali, Manavadar, Kunkavav, Bhesan, Gadhada, Dhola, Savarkundla, Bagasra, Lathi, Liliya, Khambha, Rajula, Jafrabad, Talaja, Mahuva, Gariadhar, Songadh, Uchchhal, Malegaon, Bardoli, Mandvi, Kamrej, Olpad, Mangrol, Umarpada, Valod, Nizar, Chikhli, Vansda, Dharampur, Pardi, Umbergaon, Kaprada.

This is a nightmare for anyone who has bought or is considering buying an Ola scooter. Fancy ads and government subsidies cannot make up for a company that cannot even service its own products. If you’re thinking of buying one, stop right now. Save your money and sanity, and go with a brand that actually supports its customers.",0.96,37,0,37,en-IN

Many people still thinks that if they are brown or black they will not be loved and would be robbed off opportunites and would be judged.  I had an encounter like this where my ex girlfriend was brown in color and was insecure abt it.  She used to say am not white so am not beautiful. 
I used to spread positivity and she did used to feel a bit good but then used to say u only saying cause u dont wanna hurt me in reality u also like white color people . Then i realized how bad these people feel and are insecure

Then i got to know that most of face whitening cream is been purchased by indians and we people ourselves do not want to accept our skin tone .  We living in our country see racism based on color on daily basis either on internet or irl.  

And i think one main reason for this increase in insecurity is because of instagran . Many people are ysinf maekup and filter so thay they can look good and present themselves on camera and then people starts to gain complex because most of them are showing white skin and they are gettinf validated . I love brown skin its so authentic and good , it gives warm vibes . Anyway i also got fooled by these instagram influencers i used to feel how are their skin so clear and glowing all the time while i have dark circles . No Matter how much i exercise and sleep and good i eat i was unable to see my skin gettin at the level of theirs then i asked my friend ( female ) she told me most of them use corrector which evens the skintone across the face and they put makeup too and that what u see is not real they are just showing the perfect version of themsleves. 

THIS SO CALLED PERFECTION  we chase in beauty that we are slowly normalizing it and if u point out to a person why u using so much makeup and filters they will come aggressively at you and will bash you just for asking this simple question . 

Social validation is more important these days

The premise of this land has always been **Freedom, Liberty, Unity in Diversity, and Scientific Temperament**. Our culture teaches us to protect and enrich our ecology. Sonam Wangchuk, through both words and actions, has embodied these values.

I will not comment on the merits of his arrest and charges — those will be judged in court. What concerns me is the organized character assassination by hyper-active accounts. Cropped clips, twisted narratives, and systemic misinformation should alarm us all.

For almost six years, the protests were peaceful. Pressure was raised only so the government would listen. It is unfortunate that violence erupted — whether or not he had a hand in it remains unproven.

But one fact cannot be denied: Sonam Wangchuk has consistently raised India’s flag on the world stage. He is among the finest citizens of this country. Until proven otherwise, he deserves the dignity and rights guaranteed to every Indian.

So the real question is — will we defend not just this man’s rights, but our own? Because in protecting him from misinformation, we are in fact protecting our own **freedom of expression**.

**And remember: whenever someone tries to make it about the army or national security, it usually means it’s about something else.**

Left or Right, we will continue to debate and disagree. But orchestrated vilification of citizens must stop. That is the debt we owe our forefathers — and to our next generations.",0.85,55,0,55,en-IN

india,How Maga and anti-Maga have invoked ‘Miga’ (Make Indians Go Away) sentiment in America,"I've been a lurker on here for some time, mainly for the news, but felt compelled to make an account and post this, because it seems like a pertinent matter which isn't really being discussed with the seriousness it deserves.  
  
Wanted to hear people's opinions on this thing, about the astronomical rise in hate against India and Indian people on social media, which now seems to be transforming into extremely dangerous situations in real life.  
  
Over the last few months, we have heard of the violence against Indian people in Ireland and Australia, the gruesome killing of Nagamallaiah in Dallas in the USA. And there has been no real outrage over these incidents either on conventional media or on social media.

Now, I know the government has been hands-off on many things where it should've been much more hands-on, so I don't really expect anything from them.   
I only want to discuss this from an individual and societal lens.

Is it just me, or are we Indians, as a wider society online and offline, too naive to distinguish racisst hate from good-faith criticism and discussions, allowing racist trolls the ground to spew hate against us without any retaliation?  
I believe we are too quick in dismissing anyone (Indian or otherwise) who calls out the racism against us, by internalizing the racist dog-whistles and blaming different communities of our own society to deflect the racism onto, and to ""whitewash"" our own images in front of the racists.   
All this North vs South, language disputes, sanitation problems, casteism problems, Biharis bad, Telugus bad, Indian Civic Sense shtick etc. , seem to be such issues which our own people use to internalize the racism, or deflect the racism onto other communities, instead of standing up to racists without airing our dirty laundry every waking moment.",0.81,74,0,74,en-IN

* During the hearing, the official came online and said he had ""missed the file online"" and would provide the information if I went to his office.
* I took down his number in front of the Information Commission judge and then confirmed he would be there two days hence. When I reached his office, he took me to the records section and the clerk said, sorry the file is not available, come back!

india,"Understanding Pricing &amp; Margins in Paintball (SP Warzone, Madurai)","Running a paintball arena isn’t just about the thrill it’s also about balancing input costs and output value to arrive at the right pricing.

Key Input Costs:

* 🎯 Bullets &amp; consumables
* 🔧 Gun maintenance &amp; gear upkeep
* 👕 Suit washing &amp; repairs (guards stitched bi-weekly)
* 👨‍💼 Employee salaries &amp; support staff
* ⚡ Electricity &amp; utilities
* 🛠️ Miscellaneous extras (safety, field maintenance)

These recurring costs directly impact the sustainability of the business.

Output &amp; Revenue:  
At SP Warzone, our structure revolves around hourly packs and corporate/group packs. On average, we generate about ₹5,000 per customer depending on the package.

Pricing Insight:  
For paintball, the right pricing is not just about covering costs it’s about:

1. Ensuring customers perceive value for money.
2. Building in a healthy margin to cover wear-and-tear + future upgrades.
3. Offering flexible packages (hourly vs corporate) so different customer segments feel catered to.

In this business, profits are earned not by overpricing, but by repeat visits, word-of-mouth, and scaling through groups.

The lesson: Track inputs religiously, price outputs smartly, and always leave room for experience upgrades. That’s what keeps margins healthy in a leisure/adventure business.",0.36,0,0,0,en-IN

I was told that its a morally grey area and that its not illegal.

&gt;They are showing you the discount they are giving. They are not doing anything illegal here. When you see the amounts, you immediately think that you have a 50% discount because they mention the amount on the invoice and not the percentage.

&gt;

&gt;It is not illegal. It is a morally grey area.

**Well guess what, turns out i was right.**

I trusted my gut and actually complained both in NCH ( got closed without any use or compensation) and GST commission.  This action maybe taken as part of mine or someone else's complaint, i have no idea. But sometimes, trusting one's gut actually gets results.

If you guys feel like something is wrong, dig, dig , keep digging. I hope atleast future buyers dont get fleeced and I'm happy that some action is being taken for these practises.

They were fined for : "" ***deceptive pricing, misleading advertisements under Section 2(28), and unfair trade practices under Section 2(47) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.*** ""

&gt;***By representing the price as tax-inclusive and then levying GST at checkout, the company engaged in “drip pricing,” a dark pattern under the Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023, which misled consumers about the final payable amount and undermined informed decision-making.***

The real problem is that a big and talented country like ours has ignored real global sports like football. Corruption and politics have finished all the chances

BTW, even some of the prominent cricket playing countries has given equal importance

South Africa: FIFA ranking 55. Roasted 2010 FIFA. 

Newzealand: FIFA ranking 82. Qualified for 2026

India: FIFA ranking 134. Never participated in FIFA, never hoasted FIFA. The last ever FIFA qualification was in 1956. 

Even the most anticipated Indian football leagues, which were supposed to revive football in the country, (i-league and ISL) are suffering due to politics, mismanagement, and constant governance issues, leading to uncertainty for clubs, players, and investors alike

Let’s hope God puts some sense into India’s politicians and football governing bodies to seriously revive and reform the game, so that football in India can finally rise free from politics and mismanagement, and realize its true potential on the world stage

I wanted to tell my aunt but one day he groped me in front of her and she didn't even react as if it's okay to happen. I can't tell her now as I'm scared she'll tell my uncle and I don't know what will happen.

I'm very scared because my aunt and her kids will not be at home for two days and I will have to stay with only my uncle in the house. I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I asked my parents for hotel but they can't afford it and I can't force them because I know the conditions.

india,Learning about Indian culture as a foreigner?,"Hey everyone,

I’m an Aussie who’s really keen to start learning about Indian culture, but honestly, I’m not sure where to begin. The more I look into it, the more I realise just how huge and diverse it is. There are so many languages, regions, religions, histories, and traditions all coexisting, and I think that’s what makes it so fascinating. But it also makes it kind of hard to know where to start without feeling totally lost.

I’ve always been curious about cultures different from my own. I’ve spent a fair bit of time in China, East Asia, and Europe, and each experience has completely shifted my perspective. But when it comes to South Asia, especially India, I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface. And that’s something I really want to change.

Part of what’s sparked this interest is that I work with and interact with Indian and South Asian people every day. I’ve always admired how strong the sense of community is. Whenever there’s a festival or cultural event, the energy, the turnout, and the way people show up for each other is honestly amazing. I think gaining a deeper understanding of the culture would help me connect even more with the people I work alongside and care about, and just broaden my perspective in a really meaningful way.

Another reason this matters to me is because I’ve noticed a lot of growing racist or xenophobic rhetoric in parts of the West (and online) even here in Australia. And I hate seeing that. I want to be someone who can speak up and stand beside new migrants and communities that are too often misunderstood or targeted. But I also feel like if I want to do that meaningfully, I need to put in the effort to learn to really understand the people, not just defend them out of principle.

So if anyone has any tips or suggestions on how to start exploring Indian culture, I’d love to hear them. Whether it’s movies, music, food, beginner language resources, history, or just personal advice, I’m open to anything. I’m genuinely excited to learn and would really appreciate any help from people who live and breathe this culture every day.

Thanks so much in advance.

india,A Friendly Share: How I Personally See Religion,"The truth is, Hinduism originally started more as a philosophy than a formal religion—it started more as a philosophy, a way of understanding life, the universe, and ourselves. Over time, the idea of “religion” as a structured system came from the West and arrived in India much later through trade and the era of the Sultanates. But the essence of Hinduism—and really, any philosophy—is about guiding yourself toward growth, understanding, and strength. You don’t have to fit into a rigid label; you can follow the ideas and practices that resonate with you, that help you grow, and that make you a better person.

Many people might label you an atheist or question your beliefs, but that’s okay. What truly matters is how you live your life, the principles you uphold, and the ways you build yourself—mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Society has always tried to control people, and religion has often been one of the tools used for influence. In the past, kings and rulers guided people through it; today, it sometimes comes through religious leaders or self-proclaimed “saints.” Recognizing this helps you see that your path doesn’t have to be dictated by others.

At the end of the day, it’s about focusing on what makes you strong and what empowers you. Learn from different philosophies, adapt what makes sense, and live by principles that help you grow. Don’t get caught up in arguing over definitions or worrying about what others think religion “should” be. Instead, focus on what helps you become your best self, what strengthens your character, and what guides you toward a life of meaning and resilience. That is what truly matters.",0.65,13,0,13,en-IN

india,"Flipkart &amp; Realme are running a scam: Delivered defective Realme P4 Pro, refusing replacement, deliberately wasting 7-day window","I want to share my frustrating experience with Flipkart and Realme because I strongly believe they are deliberately scamming customers by delaying replacements until the return window lapses.

Timeline of Events:

22 Sept (Night): Ordered a Realme P4 Pro from Flipkart, delivered via open-box delivery. Phone looked fine initially.

Same day: Noticed a major screen issue, when I move the Spotify app, its logo leaves a white imprint/ghosting effect for 5-10 seconds. Immediately contacted Flipkart. They arranged a technician visit for 25 Sept.

23 Sept: Technician called saying he’d visit, but never showed up. My calls never connected. Flipkart kept refusing to give me his number and suddenly cancelled the visit, without my request. I had to raise another return request. Now deadline shifted to 26 Sept.

23–26 Sept: Repeatedly received SMS/WhatsApp messages saying “technician visit cancelled as per your request” — but I never cancelled. In the Flipkart app, it still showed as active. Clearly a tactic to waste time.

25 Sept: I even went to a Realme service centre. They took my phone and said they’d resolve it by 7 PM. Later said “waiting for company’s reply.” On 26th they again pushed it to the 27th. Today (27th) they said only on 29th Sept they’ll update.

Meanwhile Flipkart support keeps repeating “wait another 24 hours” and keeps cancelling my return requests. Some Flipkart executives say “Realme is responsible for replacement,” while Realme says “Flipkart is responsible.” Both are passing the blame.

Why this feels like a scam?

Flipkart has a 7-day replacement window. They are deliberately delaying technician visits and making fake cancellation claims. Once the 7 days are over, they’ll simply say “sorry, window has expired, can’t replace.”

Realme service centre is also dragging its feet, keeping my phone and refusing to give a direct resolution.

I have already raised a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (INGRAM), but I fear Flipkart and Realme are deliberately harassing customers to escape liability.

I am a CA student, and they have already wasted 5 days of mine. I literally paid ₹20,286 for a defective phone that neither Flipkart nor Realme is willing to replace.

I know I’m not the only one. If this is happening to me, it’s happening to many others. These companies rely on people giving up quietly. I refuse to be scammed.

Has anyone else faced the same? Any advice on how to force Flipkart/Realme to replace my phone quickly?

india,"I'm very much angered due to these dishonest workers &amp; Corrupt shopkeepers . No things are getting fixed. AC, scooter, washing machine etc everything not working properly even after giving them Full money . Corrupt shopkeeper openly looting by selling poor quality products and not even replacing it","How will a common man survive the corruption and greed of these companies that are rolling out low-quality products to squeeze more money from customers, and the servicemen or mechanics who take advantage of the situation?

In the past few years, every product has started becoming faulty within just one year, and none of them have been properly repaired.

I bought an AC, and within just 2 years it got damaged badly. After that, even our old mechanic couldn’t fix it.

The washing machine also isn’t getting repaired.

Both of our scooters aren’t getting repaired either.

The water purifier is also not being fixed.

Whenever we buy any new item — like recently I bought a shower and a toilet — even the toilet pot isn’t working properly. The flush isn’t functioning.

These companies deliberately sell low-quality products so that they break down quickly and the customer is forced to buy them again and again. After that, these mechanics also take advantage of the situation.

I don’t know how difficult life is going to get in the coming years. Now I’m even starting to think it’s better not to buy anything new at all — whatever old things we already have seem better.

Every day I end up fighting with my parents over the fact that they get old things repaired unnecessarily or replace them, even when everything is working fine. I had told them that they sell old things just to pass time, and the new ones often turn out to be defective.

Since COVID-19, everything has started breaking down, and even the mechanics do poor-quality work. Yet, my parents keep calling them, give them money in advance, don’t get the work done properly, and don’t even check it afterward.

Because of this, I’ve been having daily arguments with them for the past week, especially in the mornings, and now I’m extremely angry.",0.92,62,0,62,en-IN

I’ve been dealing with something really frustrating and stressful. The **Axio loan team** (who provide Amazon Pay Later in partnership with Karur Vysya Bank) has been harassing me with daily calls for over a month now.

They keep pushing me to take a loan of 5 Lakh, even though I’ve refused multiple times. I clearly told them I’m not interested, yet the calls never stop. It’s reached a point where I feel mentally harassed.

To make it worse, I informed them that I’m currently on bedrest due to a fracture, so I specifically requested not to be disturbed in the evenings. But they *deliberately* keep calling at that time, disturbing my rest.

One of their staff members, **Anuj**, even told me to send an email to stop the calls. I did that, but got no reply and the calls continue as usual. Feels like they are simply ignoring my requests.

I even filed a complaint with **RBI** asking them to take action against Axio and Karur Vysya Bank, but honestly I don’t think that will help. Please, if anyone knows how I can actually stop this, tell me.

The worst part? I can’t even talk to their customer support. They don’t have a call option – only WhatsApp “help support,” which just asks for product details to proceed. There’s literally *no way* to talk to a human being. Meanwhile, these people are spamming me nonstop.",0.89,26,0,26,en-IN

india,Family property distribution is making me feel sidelined,"We had some ancestral land about 90 acte which just got acquired during the redevelopment. We received money for it. I didn’t have a problem with that at all. But now, with that money, my family is buying plots, making FDs, and investing in different places.

I come from a background where daughters usually don’t get a share. Technically, I could claim mine, but culturally, girls don’t. I never thought of asking, I never expected anything. But now, seeing everything unfold in front of me makes me feel bad.

My father is buting multiple plots for my brother and sister in law.They’re transferring ownership to both of them,making them official owners. I feel like its because they want to keep me from having any rights in the future (since as a daughter, I’d still legally have a claim if it stayed in my parents name) so their priority is clearly making sure my brother and sister-in-law are secure, almost as if they want to avoid me asking for my share in the future. They don’t say it openly, but I can feel it.

I even asked my dad about it: “You’re doing it because of me, right? Like why else won't you transfer anything to your name?"" He told me, “No, we’re not doing that. We trust you, but you never know what kind of in-laws you’ll get; what if they force you to ask for your share? Or torture you for it."" And I calmed down. I thought I was overreacting. I told myself I was being petty.

But then something happened with my bhabhi that broke me. My brother teased me “You’re not getting anything.” It was said jokingly, but it hurt. In anger I blurted out something “You should be grateful to me because I’m leaving my share to you. I’m giving it to you in bheek.” 

My sister-in-law immediately got offended, my brother didn't. He just laughed.She said, “What do you mean by that? This belongs to your brother. He’s getting his rightful share. You aren't giving him anything, it's already his.This is not how it works.” She even told me that in her own home, she didn’t get a share either, so I had no right to talk like that.
I tried to cover it up by saying I was joking, but the truth is, her words cut deep. She looked at me like I was being unreasonable, problematic, even disgusting for bringing it up.

It’s not even about the property anymore. It’s about how dismissed I felt as a daughter, as a person, like I don’t even belong, like my rights or feelings don’t matter.
I love my brother. I truly do. I want the best for him. I don’t want to be the reason for his unhappiness. I would never take money from him, or do anything to harm his future. If they had simply asked me, “Are you okay with giving this to your brother?” I would have happily said yes. But they aren’t even asking me.

Two  years ago, we were a family of four. Now it feels like I’m on the outside. I told my mom today  that I feel like I don’t belong anymore. She said I was being overdramatic and reminded me they’d spend a crore, or lakhs, on my wedding, that would be my share. But the truth is, that money won’t be mine. It’ll go on food, on gifts for my in-laws, on showing society. Not on me

I hate this feeling. I  hate that my own home doesn’t feel like mine anymore.

The truth is, I’m not angry about money. I’m hurt about trust, about being sidelined, about feeling like I don’t belong. It’s not even about what I will or won’t get, it’s about how everything is happening right in front of me, while I stand there invisible. I feel bad, then guilty for feeling bad, then ashamed for even thinking about it. ",0.96,273,0,273,en-IN

And yet, the exact thing I was calling out happened immediately after - my DMs flooded.

Men calling me an “attention seeker” and a whore. Men demanding hookups or asking to “meet.” One even decided I must be a gold digger who only likes rich boys because “they can cover my expenses.” Absolute garbage. And of course, these creeps don’t disappear - they keep lurking, commenting, posting, like parasites.

And instead of accountability, what’s the advice I get? Just ignore it, close your DMs, post less, stay in your limits. Even educated men repeat this like it’s wisdom, when really it’s just cowardice. Someone even suggested I should pretend to be a man online to avoid this hassle. Do you hear how ridiculous that is? Instead of telling men to stop being harassers, I’m supposed to erase my identity just to exist in peace?

Yes, I’ve closed my DMs. Yes, I press ignore every time. But why is the burden always on women to shrink, hide, or change ourselves, while men roam around unchecked, harassing like it’s their birthright?

And it’s not just DMs. Recently, a guy even twisted a casual conversation about songs into me “liking him.” When I didn’t play along, he called me toxic. Like… when the hell did that even happen? 🤡

This is the reality: women say “my presence is not an invitation,” and instead of respecting that, men double down. And society still tells us to adapt.

Existing as a woman is not an open invitation. My life, my words, my posts are not an invitation . Men need to get it through their thick skulls, the problem isn’t women existing, the problem is men who can’t handle a “no” without turning into creeps.

1947: While India inherited a tattered economy at independence, much of the rest of the world was also in a dire situation due to war and colonialism, and thus India was #6 in terms of GDP.

1947-1991: India's economic growth severely lagged behind almost the entire world (including Pakistan) due to license raj and state socialism, and India tumbled down to #17 before liberalization.

1991: Liberalization, privatization, and globalization unleashed India's true potential under PV Narasimha Rao bringing the ranking up to #12 by the end of Bajpayee's term.

2004-2014: Was a time of missed opportunity when India climbed merely 2 ranks in 10 years despite the previous momentum because of corruption scams, inflation, and debt crisis, with India earning the label of ""fragile 5"".

So apparently, all humans are sinners and Jesus who is actually God himself, died for our sins 2000 years ago. Now all we need to do is agree that he died for our sins and we will go to heaven. My question is, if God knows humans are sinners, why did he create us? If we have to agree that he died for our sins, then where is my consent? I did not ask for this life. If all humans are sinners, what was the fault of the month old baby who was detected with cancer ? If we actually agree that Jesus died for our sins, and commit more sins we will still have a chance to go to heaven but if we do not agree that Jesus died for our sins but have an absolute sin free, morally upright life we will not be able to go to heaven.

Garg, who reportedly drowned while swimming on a yacht in Singapore after experiencing breathing issues, has sparked mass mourning and accusations of negligence against organizer Shyamkanu Mahanta and manager Siddhartha Sharma.

**Fans have directed their anger at the duo, alleging mismanagement despite Garg's health concerns. In response, authorities formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe charges of criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and death by negligence under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).** The outcry escalated into violence when a mob stormed Sharma's Guwahati residence during an SIT search, leading to stone-pelting at police vehicles. Police resorted to lathi charges and arrested nine individuals.

In a Facebook Live session, Sarma emphasized maintaining peace, invoking local icons like Lachit Barphukan and Bhupen Hazarika over foreign examples. He summoned Mahanta and Sharma to appear before the CID by October 6, warning against evading the law, and announced the freezing of Mahanta's bank accounts. Both have cited safety fears for delaying their return to Assam.

Just check the number of people who watched India vs Pakistan Asia Cup final. Isn't it civics sense to support our army or the people who have suffered as well? What happened to the boycott?

This cup is not important. Everyone knows it. And still, politicians, BCCI and average Indians are watching and celebrating? Did everything become ok after boycotting the first match?

My biggest disappointment is the average citizen of the country. No one had forced us to watch the match. But so called ""middle class and well to do class"" were watching in full strength (not the lower class - our regular scapegoats for ""civic sense""). Who are u going to blame now but the person standing in the mirror?

Bottom line: We just don't have the ethics and discipline to become a super power. If we cannot stay strong for such trivial and zero-consequence matches, forget about patriotism and standing by the nation when it would really matter.

IndiaSpeaks,"Understanding the underpinnings of Leftist Ideology, and what it actually is","This is a *very long* post on a number of first principles of what Leftist/Liberalism Ideology in general is.

To start with, let's take a look over at how it begins - with the so-called ""Enlightenment"" era of Europe.

It is worth understanding that a lot of modern political ideologies fall under a single umbrella that can be described as Humanism - broadly, this involves putting human needs, wants and aims at the center of political and public life.

It has its roots in several cultures globally (for example, Saamkhya and Caarvaka in Sanatana Dharma) but in the case of Europe it was a revival of Classical Greco-Roman Philosophy and as a backlash to the largely Church-dominated mainstream that was public and social life in Europe for the better part of over a thousand years. It is no coincidence that interest in Classical Greco-Roman Culture and Philosophy jumped up roughly about the same time the Christian Church began to lose political power and social influence in Europe (from about the 1600s to the 1700s, you will see the Pope drop completely out of history books in Europe).

In very general terms, Humanism can be organized into three groups -

* Classical Humanism - Liberalism, Capitalism, Democracy, Libertarianism. These strains of thought put the rights of the individual over all others and believe strongly in free association and the free market above all else as a natural outcome to handling social problems.
* Left Humanism - Communism, Socialism, Anarchism. These strains of thought put the equality of all individuals and communities over all other precepts and believe strongly in collectivist approaches, forced association and melding to handle social problems, over and above the rights of individuals if necessary for the greater good.
* Right Humanism - Nationalism, Populism, Racial/Religious/Cultural Supremacism. These strains of thought put the rights, welfare and achievements of one In Group over the Out Group, by force if necessary. Individuals within the In Group have free association and rights of the kind propounded by Classical Liberalism, those of the Out Group are denied some or all of those things.

For the purposes of this post, we will restrict ourselves to looking at Classical and Left Humanism. Note that the categorization above is a very general and oversimplified one, but which will give you some idea of what you're looking at and why people within those ideologies do what they do. It also must be stated that in our current age, various strains of Humanism are the de facto prism we look at the world with.

The thing you've got to realize is the context for all of these ideological principles - they are essentially a revolt against Abrahamism in general (and Christianity in particular). The irony is that much of the basis of it (and even their end goals) is still ultimately Abrahamism, just worded differently.

Just to give an example, the opening lines of the American Declaration of Independence -

*We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.*

You will notice some points here. One, that all men are created equal i.e. by the Abrahamic God - a jealous male God who accepts no others as his peers, who has given them certain rights (i.e. which non-Abrahamics, by implication, *do not have*). Two, that it is self-evident - which is to say, ""because I said so, that's why"" which are the *basic principles of congregationalism and prophetism* that are the foundational pillars of all Abrahamism.

From a purely objective standpoint, *every single statement of those opening lines is false.* From a purely materialistic perspective, Evolution is based on differences, not equality - you are unique but not equal. Biological life has no rights, just characteristics and abilities. They are not inalienable, but mutate and change. Liberty is essentially ""trust me bro"" on a massive scale. Happiness is simply chemical reactions in your brain.

Now, someone who's big on equality and human rights will be angry at this. They'll go ""Don't be a smarmy jerk! Of course I know people aren't equal biologically! But if we believe we are all equal in essence, we will have a stable, prosperous and just society!""

Sure. No problem with that argument.

The thing is, Hammurabi of Mesopotamia stated quite clearly that there's superiors, commoners and slaves and they're all different kinds of people. He admitted privately that there was no such thing, but if everyone believed in it and worked under it, they would create a stable, prosperous and just society.

***So who's right? Hammurabi of Mesopotamia, or the modern day defender of equality and human rights?***

That's where we get into the core argument - ***belief.***

You have to *believe* that these principles are true, otherwise you have no foundation to work with. And most if not all of its core principles are taken from Abrahamism.

Which is to say - for something that claims to be a rationalist ideology, it behaves an awful lot like a religion. *Which is exactly what it is.*

***Left and Classical Humanism (and Humanism in general) are religions.***

The difference is that instead of putting a (infallible) Deity at the center of worship, it has put (fallible) Humanity at the center of worship. To quote Voltaire - **""If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.""** It just so happens that mankind's needs have been made paramount to the exclusion of all else.

Let us take another example to illustrate this point - Communism.

* It has and had Holy Wars (against Nazis and Far-Right Ideologies, against Religion and Culture)
* Heresies (Revisionism, Eurocommunism)
* Prophets (Marx, Lenin, Stalin, etc.)
* Doctrinal Holy Books (Das Kapital, Little Red Book, Communist Manifesto)
* A Priesthood (The Party) whose words are Holy Writ
* Religious Schisms (Sino-Soviet Split, Soviet-Yugoslav Split)
* And even Inquisitors (People's Commissars and Political Officers)
* And a Promised Land/Paradise (True Communism in a World Without Borders or Classes)

In short, if it looks like a religion, sounds like a religion and behaves like a religion, it is a religion. It just so happens to also be one of the most horrifically destructive ones ever seen in human history. And if it's beginning to sound familiar to you in how West Asian religions behave - good, you're paying attention.

***So why does it fail?***

Lacking the grand perspective of an academician who has devoted their entire life to understanding it, it is a basic part of human nature to look for meaning and purpose in a cause greater than oneself, especially in a world that is very harsh and unforgiving and seemingly uncaring for normal people.

Things like Communism, Fascism, Liberalism, Conservatism etc. have tried to do this, but all of those ""-isms"" don't take into account that ""reason"", ""logic"", and ""humanism"" are - by definition - too mundane to be suited for the replacement of religion and culture, as they were and are extremely poor substitutes for finding individual meaning.

The fact that religious adherence and cultural assertion is increasing worldwide - of all religious faiths and all cultural traditions - despite more than three hundred years of attempted secularization and liberalism shows just how badly that attempt has fallen flat on its face.

More importantly, none of the theories that they use to explain human behavior have really panned out. Humans by default are self-interested, often short-sighted and predictably irrational beings.

Unfortunately, all of Left and Classical Humanism requires its adherents to be the exact opposite of all this - which means they are left wide open to be hijacked by bad faith actors (which is why they end up leading to dictatorships and some of the greatest horrors in all of human history - you are guaranteed to have Stalins, Pol Pots, Maos, Indira Gandhis and Hoxhas as a result).

***So why is this important to us as Bharatiyas?***

*Because these principles are utterly alien to our social fabric and philosophical principles.* This isn't Apples to Oranges - this is like comparing Apples to the color white. *We are trying to force fit something that was never designed for India in the first place.* Once you understand this, you will know why our governance is utterly chaotic and insane. *An immense self-violation.*

IndiaSpeaks,Embracing Civic Sense,"Me and my wife went to vegetable market yesterday and saw a dog searching for food. We purchased this Parle-G biscuit and fed him. Since there was no dustbin there, I put it in my pocket and threw it in dustbin at my home.

Honestly, earlier I also had the similar attitude that ‘yahan already kachra pada hua hain, mere daalney se kya hi farak pad jaega’ type of attitude.

But over the time, I changed my this wrong attitude and started respecting cleanliness around me because ‘Farak padta hain’.

And after looking a lot of videos around we Indians behaviour towards civic sense, I don’t want to be listed in that category. 

Even now if I feed my street dogs, I never throw any wrapper on the street.

This is not a brag post but just and example that if I can change my wrong habbit, then anyone can.

This is our country, our place and our environment and we can’t put everything on government to be taken of.

IndiaSpeaks,India First: Deport All Illegal Immigrants Without Exceptions. Your thoughts on this?,"My take one this:

So the HC now says deportation of illegal Bangladeshis is “illegal” and has even asked the Centre to bring them back within a month. Honestly, this is absurd.

Let’s be clear if someone has entered India illegally, it does not matter whether they have been here for 15–20 years, have a job, or even raised families. They broke the law by infiltrating across the border in the first place. If we start giving sympathy just because they’ve “settled”, then what’s the point of having borders at all?

Every sovereign nation has the right to secure its borders and ensure that infiltrators are sent back. If we keep tolerating this in the name of “humanitarian grounds”, more and more people will enter illegally tomorrow. This isn’t about cruelty, this is about national security and demographics.

The real question is why are our courts crying over deportation of illegals instead of supporting the government in protecting the country’s borders? When the government finally takes a tough stance, the judiciary starts pulling it down. Shouldn’t the first priority be safeguarding Indian citizens instead of worrying about those who never had the right to be here in the first place?

IndiaSpeaks,A Cold-Blooded Execution in South Carolina: Another Indian.,"This is Kiran Patel, a 49-year-old Indian-American woman. She was someone's mother, someone's wife, a pillar of her community, just trying to make an honest living at her convenience store, DD's Food Mart, in Union County, South Carolina.


On September 16, a masked 21-year-old robber came into her store. The tragedy that followed was not just a robbery gone wrong—it was a brutal, personal execution.

**Imagine the sheer terror of her final moments**:

When confronted, Kiran, my mother's age, instinctively fought back, throwing an object at the gunman.

She then ran, not just to escape, but to survive, fleeing out of the store and into the parking lot.

But the killer didn't take the money and leave. He chased her down across the register and shot her multiple times—reports suggest she was struck up to eight times—leaving her to die just feet from the safety of her store.


The money was irrelevant to him. This was a savage act of power, a cold-blooded crime that ensured her death.


**The Astounding and Shameful Silence:**

The sheer lack of national outrage is a betrayal of her memory and the pain her family endures. We see the terrifying rise of anti-immigrant sentiment online, particularly against Indian communities. When crimes like this—marked by extreme, unnecessary violence—are met with media silence, it feels like that hatred is being subtly endorsed.


We are forced to ask: Why is a murder this heinous, captured on video, receiving so little attention from major American news outlets? Is the life of an immigrant woman working late to support her family considered less valuable, less newsworthy?


This devastating crime occurred just days after the horrifying news of ChandraMulla Nagamiah, the Indian-origin motel manager who was brutally beheaded in Dallas, Texas. That incident, too, was an act of shocking, sensational violence that faded quickly from the major US news cycle.


When two acts of extreme violence against hard-working members of the same immigrant community occur in rapid succession and are met with collective media silence, it’s not an oversight. It's a systemic failure and hatred at a national level.


Kiran Patel was one of us. She deserved to be safe. She deserved justice. Most of all, her tragedy deserves to be seen, remembered, and mourned by more than just her family and community.",0.99,253,0,253,en-IN
IndiaSpeaks,My take on the Arratai app name issue,"We all heard about the Indian social media app Arattai. The name might be unheard of to north Indians. Yes I am a North Indian too and it's new to me also. I really feel we are asking the wrong questions instead of asking Zoho what different/ better do you offer from whatsapp we are asking for a name change. How are our priorities so wrong. We have so many different foreign brands in India with names unheard of in our culture. We don't demand a name change instead we see what that brand has to offer or does better than others then why this treatment to an app made in India by an Indian company. As a North Indian I also heard it the first time but for me the main questions were how is it better than whatsapp, what features does it offer, does it offer security, privacy etc. I personally feel things or/trends take time to establish it took us alot of years to move from ' Message me' to 'Whatsapp me'. Grammatically there is nothing that exists like WhatsApping someone but we say it so commonly in our daily lives. So imo we should give this app a chance to do it's best if one doesn't like it or it doesn't offer value just delete it😅

I downloaded the app too for now it'll lie in the list of inactive apps. I sincerely hope that this app takes the feedback and makes this app better than Whatsapp. If not it'll be their loss cause I as an Indian gave a fair chance to the app instead of focusing on it's name.

IndiaSpeaks,How Maga and anti-Maga have invoked ‘Miga’ (Make Indians Go Away) sentiment in America - Firstpost,"An article that rather excellently details how effectively the narrative has been steadily weaponized against the people of the Indian Subcontinent, and how little we have (historically) done to stop it, to the point that our diaspora are now facing very real physical threats upon distant shores.

To quote it directly -

*To understand why all of this happened, the present article argues for a simpler, more direct explanation (not necessarily excluding some of the issues discussed by others above).* ***The short answer is: because they can.*** *America has normalised certain tropes, beliefs, and myths about Indians, India, and Hinduism so widely and deeply everywhere that only an industrial-strength exercise of imagination, creativity, and knowledge can snap us out of it.* ***It started as “because they can”, and it will soon become “because you must”.***

*That is how propaganda, social engineering, compliance, coercion, and the “Ministry of Truth” work.* ***Indians have survived as a civilisation longer than anyone else, perhaps against propaganda, but have not bothered to direct their attention to the question of how a propaganda society works.*** *We adjust to it when we enter, yes, but when we fail to see how much we are asked to “adjust” to and “adjust” into, and when we can clearly see that difference in the peer pressure and behavioural-ideological compliance pressure that the next generation faces in schools, colleges, and workplaces, we have to know.* ***This is the future. This is the present. This is the past of their societies we didn’t really ever have to see or face until we started to live deeply in them. Their society’s condition, one of ever-painful compliance, will be our future too, unless there is a change in understanding and, of course, action.***

***We don’t realise that institutions with ideological clarity about the moral or religious necessity for our extinction will prevail over our mere clicks, likes and even votes in elections. Running influence campaigns for elections in your home country is different from defeating an existentially threatening psy-op against your people living, even if in some economic comfort for now, in another country.***

*American public discourse has actually become even more careful about what can be said or not said about different minorities or immigrant groups. Yet, India, Indians, and especially Hindus, really get elevated into a special status altogether, a kind of “MFN” label, but in reverse (not “Most Favoured Nation” but* ***“Maliciously Fib-about-able Nation”****).*",0.86,26,0,26,en-IN

IndiaSpeaks,Fountain Pen discussion thread,"It has been a long time. Apologies as I was caught up in my work.

Today, we are going to be looking at another fountain pen. Specifically, **Woodex Model 4.**

**Woodex Pens** is run by Mr. Prabhakar and Mr. Narsimha Sangepu (his nephew) in Hyderabad, India. Mr. Prabhakar has decades of experience in making pens.

Woodex offers dozens and dozens of models. Ranging from tiny to pocket size to jumbo size. Mr. Prabhakar has decades worth of experience in making pens and he used to be the pen-maker behind **Deccan Pens, Hyderabad.**

  
Later, Deccan started making pens on their own so Mr. Prabhakar and Mr. Narsimha started Woodex Pens. The Woodex Model 4 has the same design and dimensions of the **Deccan Advocate.** 

The pen comes in 4 colours as of now. Polished black (as seen in the pic), Matte black, Brown-black ripple and Green-black ripple. All made in **ebonite.**

  
Ebonite is a type of hardened rubber. Sulphur is applied to the rubber and heated evenly. This causes the rubber to harden.

The pen is available in traditional eye-dropper form with friction-fit nib and cartridge-convertor type with a JoWo steel nib. The eyedropper type is available for Rs. 1500.

  
Following are the dimensions of the pen

  
Capped length - 159mm

Uncapped length - 145mm

Section diameter - 11mm

Barrel diameter - 14mm

Ink capacity (eye-dropper) - 2.5ml  


This is an excellent, value-for-money pen. for Rs. 1500. Mr. Prabhakar does incredible finishing work on the ebonite, both matte and polished. The pen looks classy too. The threads are well made and sit in the barrel with no issues.  


Everything about this pen says one thing. **VFM.**

You can select between gold and chrome clips, and gold and chrome cap rings.

If you don't want cap rings, that can also be done.

You can select between Kanwrite (Indian) and Jinhao (Chinese) nibs for eye-dropper form. Cartridge-convertor will have a JoWo (European) nib unit installed, with a Schmidt K5 convertor.

Comfortable for medium and large sized hands. The nib is a No.35 nib and can be swapped for other No.35 or international size #6 nibs in eye-dropper form.



I fitted mine with a JoWo nib (nib alone) by myself.  


**There are several other models from Woodex to choose from and there is a smaller version of Woodex Model 4 too if you have small hands.**

BollyBlindsNGossip,"Silver Screen Feminists, Real Life Antagonists","Sometimes it's so irritating to see that most people in popular media/social media celebrating these actresses as such a feminist icon, associated with women empowerment and so on. Before I start I just wanna say I am not excusing the men's behavior but just holding these ""queens"" accountable as well. 

Rani: made such problematic victim-blaming comments during the metoo movement, blatantly sheltered her rapist abusive brother, always tone-deaf about how every woman needs to learn self defense, had a full blast affair with married men govinda, adi chopra and bagged the latter one. 

Priyanka: where do I even get started? such a holier than thou attitude and know it all intellectual superiority everywhere acting how supportive she is of other women, while having a clear pattern of going after married men like akshay, srk etc. what ticks me off the most is she still milks this whole srk fiasco everywhere playing the victim. let's not forget her pick-me slutshaming comments towards Mallika to score some brownie points and show how ""sanskari"" she is after Mallika rightfully made a statement about women's issues in India. Hypocrisy should be her middle name.

Sridevi: long term affair with mithun, then with boney. being friends with boney's wife and using all her kindness while sleeping with her husband behind her back. the funniest part is how she used to tie rakhi to boney to make mithun and mona believe that he is just like a brother to her. what I hate the most here is even after marrying boney, she completely isolated arjun and anshula from their father and made him choose. 

Rekha: Okay why does this woman think having an affair with AB was the biggest event of her life and brings it up proudly EVERYWHERE even after decades. She is called an icon, a diva, a brave woman and whatnot by everyone while I still find it cringe that she still openly clings onto that AB. The way she used to call Jaya didibhai and used so much of her help to strengthen her connection makes me mad.

BollyBlindsNGossip,Tea on Varun Dhawan,"There's a lot of insecurity brewing behind the scenes of Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari, but surprisingly not between the female cast but the male leads.


Just like his every film, Varun Dhawan is hyper-involved in the marketing department of SSKTK too. He didn't expect the audience to give so much attention to Rohit Saraf after Panwadi song release. He was also quite upset that Rohit used his PR to capitalise on the hype he was getting to turn it into a popular opinion that Rohit completely stole the show from Varun. Moreover, Rohit-Janhvi's jodi and chemistry is garnering a lot of attention and buzz on social media, which Varun had initially expected from his pairing with Janhvi.



Varun also pitched his team throughout the promotions to publicize some rivalry, gossips and comparisons between Janhvi and Sanya so that the attention shifts from the entire ""Varun VS Rohit"" narrative on social media.
Contrary to rumours, there were neither any fights on sets between Sanya Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor, nor was Sanya Malhotra asked to perform a certain way to let Janhvi Kapoor shine. Now that the film's promotional run is almost over, it can be revealed that a lot of this narrative is being spread by the film's team itself because there's no better way of publicity other than nepo-bashing and controversies.



Moreover, Janhvi's role was initially being written for Alia and Tara Sutaria was the first choice for Sanya's role. Tara later backed off as she believed that if Alia is in the film, nobody else will get noticed. Post Tara's exit, multiple actresses were in talks. However, Sanya ultimately accepted the role as she was quite elated to sign a big multi-starrer family entertainer project from Dharma Productions.
After Varun, Sanya and Rohit's castings were locked, Alia had to let down the offer as she was not keen to work with Varun at this point of her career. So the role ultimately went to Janhvi who was Shashank's second choice after Alia Bhatt.



Karan Johar is confident that the film would find it's audience despite a clash with a much-awaited Pan-Indian project. The inside reports of the film suggest a well-made entertaining film.
Post the box office reception of Dhadak 2 and Homebound, do you think Karan's confidence will turn triumphant this time?",0.92,730,0,730,en-IN

BollyBlindsNGossip,A little thought on Tripti Dimri.,"Ok so this might be a late post but I had to put my heart out here. Herein tripti dimri is praising the success of saiyara film and the cast and she also spoke a bit about her memory down the lane of doing her first film. I cannot find it now but there was this interview which avinash and tripti had done after the release of Laila Majnu and tripti was saying how she was all excited for her debut and how she felt like after the film everyone will know her as the ""Laila"" of the industry.  But she was disappointed by the BO response and the oblivion the film went into. 

She did do a good job in that film but sadly the fame came much later, particularly after animal's release that prompted people to check her previous work out. Idk if I am overreacting but this was heartfelt to see her be happy for an outsider like her get the fame and name that she had once anticipated she would.

What are your thoughts? What if she was as noticed earlier? Would her filmography have had more content driven films? Of course there's no harm in doing commercial or masala movies either but she is still underutilized. 

Does timing play the biggest role in shaping an actor’s career trajectory? Or do you feel talent always finds its way, even if it takes longer?


And please do not come at me saying aneet is no outsider. I am not vouching if she is one or not. It's just about a non - nepo or tier 2-3 nepo (if she is one) making such a mark into bollywood, something that wasn't seen since a while.  ",0.91,125,0,125,en-IN

BollyBlindsNGossip,Bads of Bollywood - the illegitimate child reference.,"Why i feel that the last episode where the illegitimate child think in Bollywood is discovered, it's related to alia bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra, pooja bhatt and mahesh bhatt.

In movie it's mix of everything, just the two main characters playing story of everyone. For example the round table discussion scene between aasman singh and karishma talwar in series is from here(ananya pandey &amp; siddharth chaturvedi round table):https://youtube.com/shorts/aw_HotDAmlQ?si=gdC2KRLTY0HQhDXg

It's not directly pointing the subject. 

The cast looks very similar to alia and sid. Shooting in goa, karan johar's film. First Kiss between alia and sid in students of the year. Dating rumors of both. 

Mahesh bhatt might have not liked Siddharth Malhotra. He always liked Ranbir Kapoor. In coffee with Karan when Karan asks Mahesh on Ranbir he says good about him. But when asked who should not think of dating alia, he answers no one should think of dating alia rather i will keep her locked.

The soft pressure in series where karishma's father expect her to marry sameer sinha. Reminds me of jhanvi and shikhar pahariya.

Mahesh bhatt is rich, influential and has good contacts, hot temperament. Maybe he didn't liked Siddharth because he was a struggling outsider. In series it's shown that boy was illegitimate but may be it's alia the illegitimate one here.",0.57,1,0,1,en-IN

BollyBlindsNGossip,Amayra Dastur should be in jail,"This is old news but I saw an interview of Diganth addressing this and I felt like more people are not talking about this.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKdlBlTy-_o/?igsh=MTZsMXM2d2FqbW9tZA==

Heads up: The video is a lil annoying with it's OTT background music 

For those who don't know kannada, in this interview, Diganth is saying how she was not able to bring out a certain emotion in an intense scene and then without briefing him or giving him a heads up threw a stiletto which hit his eye. He then fell unconscious and when he saw a doctor, the doctor said ""I'm sorry you've lost your eye"". He went blind in one eye!!!!!! 

He then goes on to say how she never went to the hospital to see him even once!! He has not talked about this disaster at all. He goes on to say how he was extremely depressed for a while as he was sure this was going to end his career. 

Imagine going to your work one day and you come back home with one blind eye. How is she not in jail? How are more people not talking about this? She did not even do the bare minimum of going to the hospital to see him.

I'm so glad she has had 0 career in acting. She deserves worse if you ask me. She should be in jail.
