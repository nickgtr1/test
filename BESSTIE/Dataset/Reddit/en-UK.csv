Basically, you've been tasked by '*HM Land &amp; Revenue*' to build a village. If you're a fan of Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing, you'd love it. It's all inspired by Edwardian/Modern Britain.

Thank you for all your lovely questions during the AMA, I really appreciated the support.

I've always loved United Kingdom and England, I've only been there twice with school travels so I don't know it well at all but I always felt a strong connection with it.

I'm having a bit of a rough time, and I want to do something different in my life after I finish my job in 3 months. So I've thought about going to England to do woofing, or idk any kind of thing like that. I don't really know where I should look. I love the nature but I don't have a license so I should look around cities surely. I'm gonna spend time to look what kind of program exists that could help me find something. I'll have unemployed money so I don't look for that, more of a place to stay, activities and meeting people. I love history, for now I work in a museum in France. I was thinking York could be a good place? I'm also LGBT and would be happy to find places, spaces and people in the community. I studied art and I still enjoy a lot of it.

Deep down I think being in the nature would help me a lot and I would like to help people with something like that but without being able to drive a car it seems impossible right? 

I know this post is really random but if anyone can tell me about places that I could enjoy or has ideas about programs/projects I could go into?

Thank you a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hi everyone, thanks to the mods for allowing me to do an AMA here!

*The Home County* is a bit like Stardew Valley, but you build a village in the English countryside. Each villager has a profession, and will have a role in your village. For example, you can see the farmer planting crops above. You'll tend to your villager's needs, manage their production, pursue hobbies and decorate your village. It's all loosely set in Edwardian England, so you can choose whether to become a Lord/Lady or run your village as equals.

*'The Home County'* will release on Steam in a week. Link is in my profile.

AMA!

england,Where do you consider the West Country to start/end?,"Almost certainly included should be at least Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and probably Dorset too. Culture-wise, the rest of the south-west so Gloucestershire (Bristol has its own council now but is traditionally Gloucs) and Wiltshire is certainly more similar than different to the West Country ... on the other hand, Gloucestershire is dominated by the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean which I think are distinct from the West Country.

Herefordshire is even more dubious because its officially seen as a Midlands county, but the accent and popularity of cider is more West Country than not IMO. Plus, you still see the West Country Ales plaques outside of pubs there. That being said, it's one of England's most inland counties, and I tend to associate the West Country with the coast. Likewise Worcestershire (whose traditional boundaries actually contain part of the Black Country).

West Country-like accents can be heard as far north as Ludlow in Shropshire (that county has an almost Wurzel-Scouse hybrid accent), although that's definitely not West Country ... Salop's much too far north and was a Marcher Lordship from the 12th century, the West Country largely wasn't part of that heritage.

I mostly ask the question because I'm (originally) from the North West ... most people here think the West Country is anywhere in England south-west of Birmingham, whereas people closer to Devon, etc, are reluctant to regard anything north of Bristol as West Country.",0.91,36,0,36,en-UK

**Lower Wessex:** Dorset, Wiltshire and Bristol. (i.e. the rest of the South West excluding the Cotswolds and Thames Valley areas of north Wiltshire)  
**Upper Wessex:** The Cotswolds, Oxfordshire, west Berkshire and north Hampshire. The Cotswolds are part of the South West, but have much more in common with the Thames Valley.  
**South Coast:** Sussex, Kent and the Solent (could include Bournemouth too)  
**Home Counties:** Surrey, Hertfordshire, east Berkshire, south Buckinghamshire, south Essex and the Thames Estuary (i.e. the rest of the South East)  
**South Midlands:** Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, north Oxfordshire and north Buckinghamshire. Often gets forgotten about because the southern half of it has been swallowed by the London commuter belt.   
**Welsh Marches:** Herefordshire, Shropshire and north Gloucestershire. Historically included Cheshire and the neighbouring Welsh counties too, but not anymore.   
**East Anglia:** Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and north Essex. (I've also included the Lincolnshire fens here, which are also part of the East Midlands)

The rest of the Midlands and the North follows the generally standard boundaries, with High Peak and North Lincs included in the North. I've also split Cumbria from North West, because I've been so granular in the South.

Britain,"Britain Needs a Bold, Open Alliance ‚Äî With Canada","Since leaving the European Union, Britain has been drifting ‚Äî economically stagnant, diplomatically sidelined, and increasingly isolated. The Brexit dream of a sovereign, free-trading Britain thriving on the global stage has not only failed to deliver but has exposed the limits of going it alone in a world dominated by larger blocs and stronger powers.
We urgently need a new path forward ‚Äî one grounded not in nostalgia or political fantasy, but in pragmatism, shared values, and mutual benefit. That path is clear: a deep, formal alliance with Canada, built on full free movement of people, an open border, completely free trade, and a shared customs union.
This isn‚Äôt a sentimental call for a ‚ÄúCommonwealth revival.‚Äù It‚Äôs a strategic, economic, and political opportunity ‚Äî a chance to form a true Anglo-Atlantic union based on trust, democratic values, and aligned institutions.
Free Movement: Open Borders, Balanced Migration
Free movement has become a political third rail in Britain ‚Äî unfairly maligned and misunderstood. But with Canada, it‚Äôs different. We share a language, a legal heritage, comparable standards of living, and similar levels of education. Migration between our countries would not be a flood ‚Äî it would be balanced, organic, and driven by personal opportunity, family ties, and shared ambition, not desperation or economic disparity.
An open border with Canada would also show the British public ‚Äî and the world ‚Äî that openness does not mean vulnerability. It means confidence. It means choosing cooperation over fear.
Free Trade and a Customs Union: Prosperity Without Friction
Post-Brexit trade deals have been disappointing. Paper-thin agreements, new barriers, and increased costs have hurt British exporters and raised prices for consumers. A comprehensive customs union with Canada, eliminating all tariffs and significantly reducing regulatory divergence, would be a game-changer.
This would allow UK and Canadian companies to operate seamlessly across both markets ‚Äî increasing investment, driving innovation, and creating jobs. British consumers would gain access to affordable Canadian energy, timber, and raw materials, while Canadian households would benefit from competitive UK services, products, and technology.
We‚Äôre not talking about a symbolic agreement. We‚Äôre talking about real, frictionless trade ‚Äî the kind that drives economic growth and creates long-term stability.
A Partnership Built on Trust and Shared Values
Canada is not just an economic partner ‚Äî it‚Äôs a natural ally. We already work closely on intelligence, defence, and diplomacy. Public opinion in both countries remains overwhelmingly favourable. Our political systems, legal frameworks, and social standards are already well aligned, meaning integration would be smooth, practical, and mutually beneficial.
Unlike trying to deepen ties with unstable or authoritarian regimes, or negotiating endlessly with an ambivalent EU, a Canada‚ÄìUK alliance could move quickly and with broad public support.
Not a Step Back ‚Äî But a Leap Forward
Importantly, this would not block Britain from rebuilding relations with the EU or a future, less hostile US. Quite the opposite: it would put us back at the centre of international cooperation ‚Äî leading by example, not chasing after relevance.
In fact, such an agreement would disrupt Trump‚Äôs transactional approach to diplomacy, sending a clear message that the UK and Canada will not be passive actors in a world dominated by superpowers. Together, we would form a new kind of alliance ‚Äî one that is democratic, open, and built for the 21st century.

It‚Äôs time for Britain to re-embrace openness ‚Äî not just in trade, but in people, policy, and ambition.Let‚Äôs lead with a bold proposal: a truly open-border, free-trade union with Canada.Not as a consolation prize for Brexit ‚Äî but as a confident step into the future.",0.8,6,0,6,en-UK

Britain,Tommy Robinson‚Äôs rhetoric boils down to extrapolating gang symptoms into an Islamic takeover,"Here is the full quote from Robinson:

‚ÄúAll the blacks are gonna convert, you need to stop it. They‚Äôre gonna convert. Your black prison gangs are gonna become black jihad jihadist gangs. You need to stop it. I‚Äôve seen it in Luton. All the young black gangs, they‚Äôre all now Muslim. Two gangs in Birmingham called the Johnsons and the Burger Boys, where they used to be just black Afro Caribbean gangs, now they‚Äôre just black Muslim gangs. And they‚Äôre running everything. And Islam becomes a dominant force. And what it does is, takes people who have been wronged their whole life, lack family, lack all these things, and it gives them a sense of identity, brotherhood, belonging and it gives them a cause, and the cause is to fight the system. Because Islam will fight. So it‚Äôs a dangerous, dangerous cocktail situation that no one‚Äôs addressing and why aren‚Äôt they addressing it? Cause they‚Äôre too scared to admit the problem. The problem is you need to separate Muslims and non Muslims. And that‚Äôs a reality.‚Äù

I watched it in this video, which is when it struck me: https://youtube.com/shorts/LFv3FBdMIVg?si=2Zp8nS1wQ9fzrtDH

Although the clip is slightly edited, I think the above quote fully represents his message.

Tommy Robinson takes a real but narrow phenomenon (people with a propensity for crime converting to Islam) and then portrays radical Islam as being a huge problem and Islam as a whole taking over.

What I keep asking myself is this: why is the ideology of a small population (radical Islam gangs) the number one issue for many people?

The ideology of a gang can shape the types of crimes they commit (for example, grooming gangs motivated by a warped reading of Islam), but it does not mean there is an uprising. The gangs would have existed without Islam, and they still operate through territory and rivalry. Islam is just being used as a recruitment tool.

Robinson has made many people afraid of Islam because of the actions of a small minority of radicalised gangs.",0.92,55,0,55,en-UK

Britain,The Europeans comparing Digital ID to the European Identity Card have no idea what they're talking about,"In all the posts here regarding Digital ID I'm seeing a whole bunch of Europeans making comparisons and saying ""oh we've always had this"" and statements of the like. 

I myself am a British-Italian dual citizen. I carry an Italian identity card with me every day in my daily life regardless of which country I'm in. I'm able to tell everyone from first hand experience that it does not affect or control any aspect of my life the way Digital ID might if you consider the precedent of the current UK government's actions. 

With the laws the UK government has been passing recently over digital control, censorship, and surveillance, it is foolish and, better yet, dangerous, to even suggest that Digital ID truly will be just for evidence of right to work (we already have mechanisms for that anyway), or that it would, in effect, be anything like the European identity card. 

My Italian identity card does not determine whether or not I have the right to work. It does not determine what access I have to the internet. It is not used to monitor, control, or censor my social media presence online. 

Saying they are anything alike are ill-drawn comparisons that undermine the real danger of the current governments propositions.

Britain,It's time to finally reclaim your freedom and say no to Digital ID,"I suggest taking a break from quarrelling over left-right division and looking at the real problem.

Obviously, digital ID has been talked about a great deal in the last few days and I just wanted to post about it here because it is so important people become aware of this.

Whatever advantages experts and politicians come up with to sell this system, it is clearly not to benefit the UK, but to enslave its citizens.

There have been quite a few people speaking out against it, including people working in cyber security. The implications on people's freedom are enormous. It will centralise power even more and it will make people more and more dependent on technology and the government, two things that have proven very untrustworthy in the past. If people don't oppose it, we will have a situation where all of the basics of life are tied into this system. If you get locked out of it for some reason, you would lose the ability to do most everyday activities (banking, online shopping, etc.).

Pair that with a social credit system, which is inevitably going to be introduced at some point along the line as well, and you have given the government total control over your life. If you say the wrong thing, you might find yourself unable to travel, or buy essential items because you don't have enough social credit. Yes, this is a bleak picture, but it is the inevitable conclusion of the path we are currently being steered down.

Ask yourself this: Are governments often corrupt? Do politicians often lie? Are politicians people I would consider trustworthy? I think most people would answer these questions with no. Then, how can it be a good idea to hand over this amount of power to the government?

This is not about labour or tory. This system has long been planned and it would have been introduced by whoever was in power. Below is an excerpt from a recent Daily Mail article:

&gt;Mr Starmer is said to have been sceptical of ID cards on civil liberties grounds before coming over to the idea.¬†

&gt;Yvette Cooper, the Foreign Secretary, was believed to be sceptical about ID cards when she was home secretary.

&gt;But her replacement, Shabana Mahmood, is strongly in favour.¬†

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15133629/Every-adult-Britain-need-new-Government-issued-digital-ID-card-new-Keir-Starmer-plan.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15133629/Every-adult-Britain-need-new-Government-issued-digital-ID-card-new-Keir-Starmer-plan.html)

This is how it works. The people that get to the top positions are the people who are willing to do their masters bidding. If you were perviously skeptical about digital ID you better change your mind, or you won't get the job.

It is important people realise that governments don't have their best interest in mind. This should be clearer now than ever. A lot of people can see this has nothing to do with illegal immigration, it would not make much of a difference in that area. So why do they do it? To enforce more control on the public.

It's time to finally reclaim our power. Because ultimately, no government can force anything upon a population that does not comply. The people in charge are vastly outnumbered by the population. They rely on our compliance and it's finally time to withdraw it.

It might cost us some comfort, but what we gain is freedom. And if we don't go for freedom now, we may, further down the line, find ourselves in a situation where we are unable to.

EDIT: To all the people who say this is a massive exaggeration and that I am only fear-mongering:

Keir Starmer said the following today.

""And that is why today I am announcing this government will make a new free of charge digital ID mandatory for the right to work by the end of this parliament. Let me spell that out: You will not be able to work in the UK if you don't have digital ID.""

Now I don‚Äôt know if this applies to whole of the uk but this just from my own personal experience from where I live.

I think the most frustrating times was the when I was going to get on the bus meet with my friends, friends i haven‚Äôt seen in a very long time and I was very excited to meet them. Do please tell me why the bus never showed up, I waited for almost an hour and no sign of it. When I went across the road to go home after giving up I spoke to a lady who was waiting for the same bus on the other side and she said she had been there longer and it hadn‚Äôt even arrived going into the village where I live indicating that the bus wasn‚Äôt even close to us. 

Second time I was waiting for the bus to go home from college, I waited and waited and no sign of it. What made it worse is the fact that the bus stop I was at wasn‚Äôt even that far from the bus station so it clearly hadn‚Äôt even arrived at the bus station yet . I had to eventually ring my dad to come pick me up while he was in the middle of working which was very frustrating, but to add insult to injury on our way back we drove past the bus on the way to bus station. With that knowledge I can‚Äôt imagine it would of taken another 40 mins to even get to my stop.

3rd/4th was yesterday and today when I had to get on the bus to get to college and both times it was 20-30 mins late. I had to walk another 15 mins to college so I was late to college by 30 mins. 

Does make me feel truly sick and disgusted how unreliable these buses are because people like me rely on buses to get to place like work or school ect.

Britain,Would I be at risk of deportation?,"Reform (who is forecasted to win the next election) mentioned that they will scrap ILR (Immediate leave to remain) statuses for immigrants currently on one and will start deportations from there. I wanted to ask if I, and my family should be worried about this?

Me and my parents are Polish immigrants, we came here when I was 4 (16 years ago now). Both of my parents work full time jobs, pay their taxes and own a house. I am a Biomedical science student currently doing a placement in an Oxford hospital (NHS Blood and transplant) and I work in stem cells but I am on a 1 year unpaid contract so I don‚Äôt earn anything. Both me and my parents have Polish passports, and have ILR status. I have two mother tongues as I learned English and Polish at the same time and my parents speak English decently (though with an accent and in case anyone would be interested my mother would like to find a friend to speak English to but she is very timid and insecure about her language skills). 

Either way, with all of this, is there a chance for us to be deported solely based on this information?",0.89,55,0,55,en-UK

But also all others.

Hello all. I'm an American from California although at this point I'm almost ashamed to admit it. I am but one person, but I wanted to express how deeply embarrassed my friends and I are at Donald Trump being our President.

We fought hand in hand against facism during World War 2 and other times. For most of my life, the United States, while flawed, was overall a good and decent country. Now for a very long list of reasons I won't bore you with here, we have fallen into disrepute. 

We are sorry. Please know that many of us don't support the orange clown who was not worthy to be seen with your King.

Britain,Recently I've decided to stay engaging with the far right via Facebook and I've moved interesting patterns.,"Firstly my wall has gone from being full of mostly left wing pages to very right wing pages, it was a quick change too, just by commenting on a couple of Daily Mail and Daily Express posts i now get Farage, Reform , Gbeebies, various flag shagger groups and individual far right groups that all seem to be largely identical and masquerade as the page of a real person rather than as a Facebook group. 


Next the same handful of responses come up, the most common when talking about migrants is ""why don't you house some then?"" My typical response is ""i pay tax to the NHS and they deal with my healthcare, i pay tax and children are educated, i pay tax and the fire brigade handle fires so why should i pay tax and look at migrants myself. Do you want to handle fires yourself?"" 


This often shuts them up suggesting they are either parroting something they've seen others post which i think it's most likely as racism doesn't work if you think about it, your need to just spew forth what you've heard from others. The other possibility is that they have received training and the response to that is being covered at a future meeting. 


There is the usual hypocrisy, violent far right protests in the Netherlands are good, one Muslim being convicted of a minor crime is proof all Muslims are criminal scum and they probably have child pornography too.

They ignore the fact that flags being put up is vandalism and that the cost of removal is huge. They don't realise the council, by law, have to remove them otherwise they would be breaking the law. They happily cause government spending themselves but when it comes to migrants in hotels any amount is too much for them. 

They use language i thought was dying out in the 90s and dead by this century. Clearly whatever hive these people live in that sort of language lives on. 

Sadiq Khan is a friend of all Muslims, he hates Britain and everything he does from low emission zones to supporting public transport is a Muslim plot to take over the UK. He is also solely responsible and behind any crime in London and it's only Muslims that commit crimes, often referred to as ""Khan's mates"". 

Also Greta Thunberg is the worst human being ever and she has silly hair. 

It's been an interesting few weeks picking on the far right and i shall continue. Only one was unhinged enough to threaten my extended family in a vague way. Everyone else just seems to think I'm under 20 and a communist. I'm 39 and just left wing and only sat left when I'm feeling unhinged. 
One made me laugh, they were spewing all sorts of vile hatred about migrants.

About a year ago I had my naturalisation ceremony and a bunch of my friends threw me a party. One friend got me a Union Flag (half as a joke) as a gift. I‚Äôve since flown this flag outside my house because I like what it represents, but with everything that‚Äôs happening now a few people have told me it‚Äôs now being perceived negatively.

I‚Äôve never had a desire to shag the flag, and as an immigrant obviously I‚Äôm not doing it as a political message against immigration, but I can see how it can be conflated as a political statement. Do you think I should:

a. Stop flying the flag outside my house.
b. Keep the flag and ignore any negative perceptions.
c. Join reform and keep them out.

unitedkingdom,I took the More in Common MRP Poll and simulated various electoral pacts.,"Given [last nights MRP poll](https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/latest-insights/more-in-common-s-september-mrp/), I became curious about what the results would look like if electoral pacts were formed.  I downloaded their constituency level projections, and wrote a python script which recalculates the results under different possible  pacts.  That is, what if, say, Labour and Lib Dem agreed to stand down in constituencies they were best placed to beat Reform in.

## How it works

As parameters, this model takes:

1.  A list of ""factions"", such as ""Lab + LD + Green"" vs ""Conservative"" vs ""Reform"" etc.

2.  A list of regions they would agree to do this in, such as ""England and Wales, but not Scotland"".

3.  The public's adherence to this.  So if Lib Dem stood down in one constituency, how many of their voters would actually go to Labour, and how many would stay home, as percentages.

4.  ""Tolerance"", which is how far in the lead the stronger party has to be for the pact to apply.  So if Labour are polling 25%, and Lib Dem are at 24%, and the tolerance is 5%, the pact is off in that constituency.

5.  The constituency level More in Common projection.

It's complex to accurately mark each constituency's region, so I just called every region where Plaid are polling better than 20% ""Wales"", and every one where the SNP are polling better than 20% ""Scotland"".  Everywhere else is England (NI is not included in More in Common's poll).


## **Results**

There are infinity possible scenarios, so I've picked out a few which I deem of most interest.

**L+ LD + G tolerance=0, 100% adherence, UK-wide:**

In other words, those three parties form a pact where whichever is even slightly in the lead against the other two is the only one to run in a seat, and 100% of the voters from the other parties come over.  Aka ""fantasy land"".

    Labour                           333
    Reform UK                        155
    Liberal Democrat                 113
    Scottish National Party (SNP)     10
    The Green Party                   10
    Conservative                       7
    Plaid Cymru                        2
    Other                              1

Can't see why Lib Dems would allow this for Labour.

**L+ LD + G, tolerance=4, 65% adherence, UK-wide:**

In other words, anywhere that one of those parties is leading the others by at least 4%, the other two drop out, and 65% of their would-be voters come over to the remaining party.  In my opinion, the best realistic case scenario (best from the perspective of people who want such a pact).

    Reform UK                        262
    Labour                           228
    Liberal Democrat                  90
    Scottish National Party (SNP)     19
    Conservative                      19
    The Green Party                    7
    Other                              4
    Plaid Cymru                        2

A hung parliament with the second place party forming the senior partner in a coalition government.  Would face legitimacy issues.

**L+ LD, tolerance=4, 65% adherence, UK-wide:**

Same as the last one, but they leave out the Greens from the pact.

    Reform UK                        317
    Labour                           162
    Liberal Democrat                  80
    Scottish National Party (SNP)     30
    Conservative                      26
    Other                              8
    The Green Party                    6
    Plaid Cymru                        2

Most likely would mean a Reform government, with C&amp;S from the DUP and a majority of 1 (given no Sinn Fein).

**L+ LD, tolerance=10, 50% adherence, just in England:**

In other words, just Labour and Lib Dem form a pact that says if one of them is leading the other by 10%, the other steps aside, and only half of their voters come over, and it only applies in England.  In my opinion, the most likely pact, if one is to happen.

    Reform UK                        334
    Labour                           136
    Liberal Democrat                  77
    Scottish National Party (SNP)     34
    Conservative                      32
    Other                              9
    The Green Party                    6

Reform majority of similar size to the 2015 election.


**L+ LD + G vs R + C, tolerance=4, 65% adherence, UK-wide:**

The best realistic case scenario from above, but Tories make the same pact with Reform.

    Reform UK                        389
    Labour                           101
    Liberal Democrat                  62
    Conservative                      41
    Scottish National Party (SNP)     25
    Other                              6
    The Green Party                    5
    Plaid Cymru                        2

Tories give their nemesis a stonking majority just so they can get the same number of seats were there no pact.

**L+ LD + C vs R + G, tolerance=0, 100% adherence, UK-wide:**

The most triggering thing for the largest number of people.  In that spirit, I've deliberately ignored the SNP and Plaid.

    Labour                           264
    Conservative                     201
    Reform UK                         77
    Liberal Democrat                  74
    Scottish National Party (SNP)      7
    The Green Party                    6
    Plaid Cymru                        2

The Centrist Dad Uniparty wins 542 seats.  Lib Dems still come 4th.

## **Shortcomings**

Broadly:

1.  More in Common round to the nearest percent, and when there's a tie it reverts to alphabetically order.

2.  This assumes that voters who don't vote according to the pact just stay home, which is an assumption to say the least.  There is such a thing as a ""Green if not Reform"" voter, for instance.

3.  The existence of such pacts would change voting attitudes in hard to determine ways.  It would certainly change certain people's votes.


## Conclusion

FPTP is nutty.  As a result, and on current polling, the ""left"" need to herd a lot of cats to keep Reform out in 2029.  Perhaps too many.",0.52,1,0,1,en-UK

In the game you build a village in the British countryside. If you're a fan of Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing, you'd love it. The game is filled with British references &amp; humour which has been really confusing some of the American streamers.

The Home County is now available on Steam, you can find it here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3672100/The\_Home\_County](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3672100/The_Home_County)",0.9,45,0,45,en-UK
