melbourne,I owe blood to the blood bank - hype me up to donate,"Hey guys.  I just remembered that I had to have universal donor blood a few years ago, about 3-4 units.  As you can imagine, my brain was pretty scrambled at the time, but I woke up this morning and suddenly went: Wait.  If they had to use universal donor, that means MY blood type wasn't available.  I figure I owe them a few litres of blood over a while.  And I'm probably healthy enough now to donate, at last.

The only thing is that, shamefully, the snap-thingie poke test in the thumb freaks me out REALLY bad.  I've had umpteen cannulas, including cannulas that went bad and sprayed blood everywhere, and STILL the thing I fear the most is the noise of that test.  I've had bones set, and nothing bothers me as much as that snap noise.  Yes, I'm a coward.  They gave it to me last year in a diabetic test and for some reason it hurt for weeks afterwards, probably my brain rather than it actually being damage.

Can folks hype me up or share if there's a different way to get the pre-donation test done?  A needle draw would be preferable to me.  Does anyone know about it?",0.93,273,0,273,en-AU

While driving on the Monash/ City-link (must be nice) to the airport. 

I noticed pretty much all the billboards up to the tunnel had their prints removed plus all the electronic billboards were switched off. 

This may just be a crazy coincidence, but I found this very unusual as if the freeway has changed their rules or something. 

Has anyone else noticed this?

I've come across some old rolls of film that have been sealed and kept in a dry cool area for about 23 years from my time as an exchange student in Japan.

melbourne,Unfair car leasing company,"Subject: Unfair Treatment by Splend Victoria ‚Äì Request for Media Attention

Good evening,

I am writing to bring to your attention the unreasonable and unfair treatment I have experienced at the hands of Splend Victoria. I hope that by sharing my story, you may be able to shed light on their practices and help prevent others from suffering in the same way.

For nearly two years, I have been leasing a car through Splend Victoria and have paid close to $40,000 for it. I have always made my payments, but due to a change in my employment, my payday shifted from Tuesdays to Fridays. I notified Splend in advance that, for two weeks, my payments would be one day late to align with my new pay cycle.

Despite my transparency, Splend‚Äôs collection team threatened to repossess my car, stating that I was only ‚Äúallowed‚Äù two late payments. I explained that the delay was just one day, but they refused to show any understanding.

Matters worsened when Splend installed a beeper in my vehicle without informing me. Each time I drove away from my home, the car would emit a loud beeping sound. As a support worker, I am responsible for transporting vulnerable clients to appointments. The constant noise made it impossible to carry out my job, leading me to lose clients and, ultimately, my employment.

Now, after paying for this vehicle consistently for almost two years, I am being forced to return it, with nothing to show for the money I have already spent. Splend‚Äôs actions have not only caused me financial hardship but have also cost me my job.

I believe this treatment is deeply unfair and shows a lack of compassion or responsibility toward customers who are trying to do the right thing. I hope you, as a respected media outlet, can help expose Splend Victoria‚Äôs conduct and prevent others from going through what I have endured.",0.22,0,0,0,en-AU

melbourne,Rant about work: why are people just discarded so easily?,"I started a casual Monash City Council job in July after many months of unemployment. The job lasted 5 weeks before they said ""sorry we've overhired and we can't give you anymore shifts."" Normally I wouldn't be mad, but I spent 6 weeks before starting actually being onboarded onto the job, chasing up with different people as there were so many delays on their end with the process. 

Additionally, after the first two weeks on the job, I had to keep texting my manager to find out when my shifts were as she was not forthcoming with the information (or only told us the day before). 

Adding insult to injury, she refused to give me a reference which I know is her right but it stings considering I'm struggling to find work again and feel I have nothing to show for this one. The manager has now left Monash to go to a different council (less than 2 weeks after telling me I will not get anymore work). What's weird is I still have access to my staff email, council intranet etc. 

What hurts is that I liked the job, liked my colleagues and worked hard because I felt my work was meaningful in a way. 

I feel really jaded; I was told over text message that I was let go - no phone call, no nothing. There was no indication the previous shift that it would be my last one. 

I understand they have a legal right to end employment suddenly with casual work, but it feels unprofessional. I would have expected this in a corporate job, not in the public service.

I‚Äôve had him for 5 weeks and the change in him has been HUGE!! He came to me with his sister Mewsette, and both were super shut down. Their owner died and they lived alone for some time üò≠ but they‚Äôre bouncing back now and boy oh boy is he affectionate and loving. 

He is a SOUL CAT. He is so adorable, and will put his paws on my chest and give me kisses on the nose and neck ü•π
He has the cutest little button of a face, and beautiful markings. He‚Äôs like a tabby tuxedo!!
He is ridiculously beautiful inside and out and is going to make his new pawrent(s) very VERY happy!!

Mewsette is a floofy QUEEN!! She is such a babe with her gorgeous big round eyes and little white chin. She‚Äôs gentle, quirky and loves a belly rub. 

Because of the loss of their previous owner, it would be comforting for them to go to a new home together, but it‚Äôs not 100% necessary as they‚Äôre not bonded. They do get along well, but don‚Äôt rely on eachother. They‚Äôre good with other cats and possibly even a gentle, quiet doggo. 

Mulberry is 4yo, he is desexed, microchipped, temperament tested and up to date with vaccinations and flea and worming. 

Mewsette is also 4yo and desexed, microchipped, temperament tested and up to date with vaccinations and flea and worming.
They‚Äôve also been tested for FIV and are negative.

Hopes of Australia and the European Union striking a landmark trade deal have received a boost, with Europe‚Äôs trade chief to head to Canberra next month for talks with senior government officials to try to seal a pact Labor is pitching as an antidote to Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff spree.

There is renewed optimism about the free trade negotiations after momentum appeared to fade earlier this year as European negotiators indicated they were instead focused on dealing with the fallout from US tariffs and striking a deal with the South American common market.

  
Following two years of deadlock over a rift to do with farm exports, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese used last week‚Äôs United Nations General Assembly in New York to lobby French President Emmanuel Macron and other European leaders over the trade deal after France and Ireland objected to market access for Australian beef and lamb.

During a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez in London on Friday, Albanese appeared confident a European free trade deal worth $156 billion was in sight, telling him he felt ‚Äúreally hopeful‚Äù about the pact and that negotiations were progressing ‚Äúquite well‚Äù.

‚ÄúI spoke to President \[Macron\] about some of the issues that were there as well,‚Äù he said, referring to a meeting in New York with the French leader.

Trade Minister Don Farrell met EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic in Kuala Lumpur last week and invited him to Australia for meetings in late October, marking the first negotiations on Australian shores. Negotiators have been clearing obstacles behind the scenes in preparation for renewed talks over the deal that¬†[could supercharge commerce worth $156 billion](https://archive.is/o/IfKM2/https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lzzo)¬†a year.

‚ÄúIn the past, they said they‚Äôd like to come, but they haven‚Äôt. Well, it looks like now they will come,‚Äù Farrell said in an interview. ‚ÄúI take that as a very, very positive sign the Europeans are serious about trying to achieve an agreement, and so are we.

‚ÄúBoth sides understand just how important it is to send a message in the current environment to the rest of the world. There are countries that do believe in free and fair trade.‚Äù

On the key sticking points around farming, Farrell said: ‚ÄúWe have an agricultural sector that‚Äôs looking to greater access into the European market. They have an agricultural sector that thinks there‚Äôs already too much access into the European market, so we have to find a compromise.‚Äù‚ÄúIf I had an answer right now ‚Äì problem solved. But the fact that we‚Äôre looking at it with fresh eyes, so to speak, is very positive.‚Äù

The moves in recent days have cleared the ground for talks over Australia‚Äôs bid to increase beef and lamb exports to Europe, while the EU is seeking better access for carmakers so they can sell in Australia on the same terms as their Chinese rivals. There is no agreement yet on¬†[Europe‚Äôs longstanding demand](https://archive.is/o/IfKM2/https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5m030)¬†to protect regional food and wine exports so that prosecco and Parma ham, for instance, could only be sold under those names if they came from Italy rather than Australia.

The deal could remove barriers between Australia and Europe at a time when US President Donald Trump is imposing tariffs that curb trade and raise prices for consumers, including¬†[15 per cent tariffs on most EU exports](https://archive.is/o/IfKM2/https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5mi7f)¬†and 10 per cent on most products from Australia. With major economies worried about their exposure to the American market, national leaders have stepped up talks on free trade elsewhere ‚Äì such as meetings between Canada and Mexico, Japan and India and a recent meeting between the EU and Asian ministers. Australia put renewed focus on trade with China when the¬†[prime minister spent nearly a week](https://archive.is/o/IfKM2/https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5meli)¬†in the Asian superpower in July.

As a bloc, the EU was Australia‚Äôs third-biggest trading partner in 2024. Two-way trade was worth $110 billion, while the EU was Australia‚Äôs second-largest source of foreign investment last year.The EU has a population of 445 million people and remains one of the few major markets with which Australia shares no free trade deal. Economic¬†[modelling commissioned by the EU](https://archive.is/o/IfKM2/https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lzzo)¬†found European exports to Australia would increase by 33 per cent with a trade pact.

European carmakers such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen incur tariffs of 5 per cent on their exports because of the lack of a free trade agreement with Australia, putting them at a disadvantage compared with Chinese cars that are free of tariffs under a trade deal with China. Vehicles from Japan, South Korea and Thailand are also free of tariffs. Sefcovic issued a bullish statement on trade deals with Asian countries when he spoke to reporters at the Malaysian meeting, although he did not name Australia.

Australia and the EU suspended their trade talks in October 2023 after a sharp disagreement on agricultural trade, given concerns about competition from Australian beef and lamb for farmers in countries including Ireland and France. There is wariness on both sides about offering any concessions unless there is confidence that the problems from the past two years can be overcome, according to trade officials who spoke on condition they not be named.

Farrell and Sefcovic met in Paris in June and this led each side to work on a ‚Äústocktake‚Äù of their positions, setting up a pathway to a potential agreement in 2026 if progress is made over the next few months.

Concerns have been raised about the speed of $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund‚Äôs roll out. Artwork: Frank Ling.

The Albanese government‚Äôs√Ø¬ª¬ø housing fund, which is supposed to build 40,000 social and affordable rental homes by 2028, spent the equivalent of just eight median-priced Sydney houses in financial year 2025, raising some concerns about the speed of the roll out and the government‚Äôs housing targets.

Launched in 2023, the $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund‚Äôs (HAFF) ‚Äúallocations supported total payments to proponents of $13,606,639 in 2024‚Äì25,‚Äù the Auditor-General Caralee McLiesh wrote in a letter to Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg.

In the three months since June 30, the government says it increased that expenditure by about $137m.

Housing Minister Clare O‚ÄôNeil said progress was being made on the roll out.

‚ÄúLabor‚Äôs housing agenda is delivering ‚Äì more than 5000 social and affordable homes completed and more than 25,000 in construction and planning,‚Äù Ms O‚ÄôNeil said.

‚ÄúHomes don‚Äôt get built overnight, but real progress is being made,‚Äù Ms O‚ÄôNeil said.

While the HAFF has ‚Äúallocated‚Äù hundreds of millions of dollars to housing projects, it only provides money to proponents when projects are completed and homes are tenanted. Actual expenditure is one of the key measures.

There is a view among some social housing developers who have won contracts using the HAFF system that it is overly complex, which slows the roll out of newly developed homes.

Recently retired Ôªøchairman of Evolve Housing, Paul Howlett, said his experience with the HAFF, was that it was innovative, but complicated.

‚ÄúI hope they get to 40,000 by 2028, but it‚Äôs honestly hard to say. That is a very ambitious target and it is very complicated.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe previous scheme was simpler, but it didn‚Äôt leverage the governments balance sheet as well. This new scheme is far more complex but it will leverage the government‚Äôs balance sheet,‚Äù Mr Howlett said.

Senator Bragg said Labor‚Äôs approach was overly bureaucratic and risked worsening the housing crisis.

‚ÄúLabor is so bad at housing, they can‚Äôt even spend the money they constantly brag about,‚Äù Senator Bragg said.

‚ÄúWho knows what the true story is. Labor has previously fudged the figures on how many houses have been built by virtue of literally buying homes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt what point will Labor realise their bureaucratic approach has not only failed a generation of Australians, but is making the housing crisis worse?‚Äù

Former members of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, now rebranded Housing Australia, which administers the HAFF, said there is a risk that given the political pressure to speed up the roll out, lower quality projects might get approved just to meet targets and speed up expenditure.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm afraid of is that the minister Clare O‚ÄôNeil probably feels under the cosh, so there might now be a race to the bottom of just getting money out the door,‚Äù the former board member said.

‚ÄúSo it all becomes projects that might be far from public transport or hospitals. You end up getting the projects but you don‚Äôt get the quality. The quality will be sacrificed,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI compare what I had to deal with before this scheme and it is much, much more complicated now.‚Äù

Another for former NHFIC board member said the new scheme has become ‚Äúa feast for intermediaries,‚Äù while another said, ‚ÄúThere were too many cooks in the kitchen.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt became complicated and it became a very bureaucratic process where people were too focused on the detail and not the outcome.‚Äù

Another board member said the $13.6m FY25 spend ‚Äì equivalent to eight median priced $1.6m Sydney houses ‚Äì was hard to fathom.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get my head around that $13m number. It seems extremely low.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think there are obviously some projects that are identified as preferred because they are in various stages of completion and ready to occupy, which means they will receive the availability payments from government. That means more government cash will go out the door faster.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut then on the other extreme you have projects that have only just got development approval or are still in the process of getting one so they might be 2 to 3 years away.‚Äù

A survey conducted by law firm Herbert Smith Freehills found that 60 per cent of participants of the first round of the HAFF confirmed that at least half of their projects have reached contractual close, with 88 per cent expecting their projects to be completed in under three years.

However, Herbert Smith Freehills finance partner, Erin Wakelin said, ‚ÄúPlanning delays, policy uncertainty \[from a potential Coalition election win which risked the policy\] and a lack of co-ordination of government initiatives have made it more difficult to attract private investors than it should be.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe sector would benefit from initiatives which improve investor confidence in project timelines and delivery,‚Äù Ms Wakelin said.",0.64,24,0,24,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,NSW Primary Industries and Regional Development confirms mass retrenchments,"Frontline research and regional jobs are set to go as DPIRD presses ahead with a restructure pitched as ‚Äúfinancially responsible.‚Äù

The NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) has confirmed it will cut regional frontline staff, despite ongoing union talks and mobility rules aimed at curbing churn and reducing costly labour hire.

The news of the retrenchments hit on Friday, with affected DPSIRD staff understood to have been given the bad news on the same day.

In communications to members, the NSW Public Service Association¬†[said](https://psa.asn.au/nsw-department-of-primary-industries-and-regional-development-reform-change-plans-finalised-228-jobs-deleted/)¬†the agency had ignored its proposals to cut senior management and ‚Äú655 temporary staff employed in affected divisions. Instead, it decided to cut 228 frontline staff from its 10 change management plans.‚Äù

The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development told¬†*The Mandarin*¬†it is now ‚Äúimplementing final change management plans following consultation with staff and public sector unions and the careful consideration of the received feedback.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe department‚Äôs executive acknowledges that this change is hard on those directly impacted. This understanding has been important in ensuring open discussion of the change plans directly with all impacted staff, and to offer them support.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe department will endeavour to find alternative roles for impacted staff within the portfolio or across agencies,‚Äù an agency spokesperson said.

However, DPSIRD maintains the changes will now¬†[see](https://www.themandarin.com.au/296811-nsw-dpird-vows-to-keep-locations-open-despite-mass-redundancies/)¬†an anticipated net reduction of 159 ongoing roles across the department from its nearly 5,000 staff, while the draft change management plans had proposed a net reduction of 165 ongoing roles.

‚ÄúThe implementation of these changes is part of the strategic refocusing of the department to better service its communities and stakeholders now and into the future,‚Äù DPSIRD said.

‚ÄúCritical to that objective is to operate in a financially responsible way. This includes some areas where projects and programs have come to their endpoint, and ongoing positions are no longer financially supported.

‚ÄúSome groups within the department have experienced uneven financial performance, and the changes will correct budget overspends.‚Äù

Be that as it may, the PSA told members that ‚Äúthe magnitude of frontline job deletion has provided the clearest of signals that the NSW government is using this budgetary situation to slash the provision of research, development and assistance to primary industries and regional economies in NSW.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen DPIRD says streamline, it should be recognised for what it is ‚Äî gutting, the PSA said.

‚ÄúThis reform does not lead to the delivery of world-class, on-farm science for NSW primary producers facing the harsh realities of climate change. It‚Äôs a development of the lowest common denominator of assistance. It‚Äôs a pivot to policy because it‚Äôs cheaper.‚Äù

The agency countered that ‚Äúall affected employees will be supported through this process and have an opportunity to be redeployed across the Department or the NSW public sector, in line with the government‚Äôs workforce mobility placement policy.‚Äù

‚ÄúPriority services such as biosecurity, natural disaster response, and primary industry research and development are being operated in the most effective and efficient manner. There will be no change to department office locations or frontline services.‚Äù

The PSA isn‚Äôt so sure.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shortsighted budgetary surrender, and it‚Äôs at the expense of regional jobs and regional economies. It will hurt the state‚Äôs prestige of providing first-class, science-based outcomes, and it will hurt primary producers.

‚ÄúThe worst bit is that it could have been undertaken in a manner that would provide reassurance to primary industry, regional economies, and a proper pivot towards new research and development proposals. DPIRD kept nearly all of the 159 senior executives and more than $60 million in temporary staff in the affected divisions. Science-based roles in the middle of operations in the field are being deleted. How can the agency claim that this won‚Äôt affect service?‚Äù

Then there‚Äôs the effect on regional employment.

The DPIRD reckons that 75% of the workforce is based in regional NSW, and that the department has reduced the number of senior executive positions by 21% since June 2023.

Be that as it may, the PSA said that the Minns government ‚Äúcan no longer claim it supports the various research stations across the state. These locations are being left to die on the vine with the concern that these stations, starved of funds and staff, will become inefficient, ineffective and ripe for closure.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the Research Assurance Division, the decision to delete 19 administrative jobs will mean more than 30,000 hours less support per year for those operations. This means the DPIRD has sought to build staggering inefficiencies into its operations. And that‚Äôs not the only division where administrative support has been slashed,‚Äù the PSA told members.

‚ÄúAt a time when this agriculture minister stood up and said that services will not be affected, that is demonstrably false. Agronomists will lose their jobs, irrigation specialists will lose their jobs, researchers and research scientists will lose their jobs, technical and program experts will lose their jobs,‚Äù the PSA said.",1.0,6,0,6,en-AU
AustralianPolitics,Republicans criticise Albanese over refusal to call new referendum.,"# Anthony Albanese‚Äôs firm rejection of a republic referendum sparks backlash as he extends royal invitation to Prince William‚Äôs family.





JACQUELIN MAGNAY and GREG BROWN

King Charles III with Anthony Albanese at Balmoral, Scotland. 



The Australian Republic Movement has criticised Anthony Albanese for ruling out a referendum on replacing the British monarch as Australia‚Äôs head of state while he is in office.



The Prime Minister said there would be no more referendums under a government he leads, talking up his ‚Äúvery respectful‚Äù relationship with the British monarchy after meeting King Charles in Balmoral over the weekend.



Mr Albanese used the wide-ranging meeting with the King to invite Prince William and Princess Catherine, along with their three children, on a royal visit to Australia.



‚ÄúI have no intention of holding any referendums,‚Äù Mr Albanese told The Australian outside Cathie Kirk, the church the King ¬≠regularly visits alongside Scottish locals when he is in residence at Balmoral.



‚ÄúIt was very good of the King to invite me here to Balmoral Castle, I regard it as a great personal honour and also an honour for Australia. It is a sign of respect His Majesty is interested in Australia as well as the state of the world, and it is always engaging and insightful to have discussions with him.‚Äù



ARM co-chair Nathan Hansford said Mr Albanese should keep the republic on the national agenda.

‚ÄúAustralia is a different country to 1999, when we last considered an Australian head of state,‚Äù Mr Hansford said. Millions of Australians have never had a say ‚Äì including younger voters and people who have made Australia home in recent years ‚Äì and many views have shifted over time. It‚Äôs reasonable to ask the question again.‚Äù



After he was elected Prime Minister in 2022, Mr Albanese appointed NSW MP Matt Thistlethwaite as a minister in charge of progressing a republic if Labor won a second term.

But the failure of the voice referendum saw Mr Thistlethwaite downgrade the issue and the portfolio was dumped in a pre-election reshuffle.



Sussan Ley is also a republican, but the Coalition does not support a referendum on the issue.



The 90-minute discussion with King Charles was held, unusually, behind closed doors inside the remote castle in Aberdeenshire, with even the Prime Minister‚Äôs aides being seen outside.



Charles continues to receive treatment for cancer and he came to Balmoral, one of his favourite residences, to recover from a busy schedule that included the lavish state banquet and visit by US President Donald Trump 10 days ago.

One of the key points on the King‚Äôs agenda in the fireside chat with the Prime Minister was the next visit by the royal family to Australia, but it was always ¬≠unlikely that the King, with his health woes, and Queen Camilla, who struggles with long-haul jet lag, would return so soon after last year‚Äôs quick trip to Canberra and Sydney en route to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Apia, Samoa in October.

Instead, the Prince and Princess of Wales, both 43, have been keen to bring their children to Australia, with the timing expected to coincide with British school holidays next year.





‚ÄúWe are hopeful that the Prince and ¬≠Princess of Wales are able to visit as well and we are hopeful it might occur in the coming period,‚Äù Mr Albanese said.

Prince George, now 12, was nine months old when William and Catherine last came to Australia in 2014.





Princess Charlotte, 10, has been on overseas tours to Canada in 2016 and Poland and Germany in 2017, while Prince Louis, 7, has not been on a royal overseas tour.





A royal tour Down Under has been on Prince William‚Äôs radar for at least six years, but the Covid pandemic, then the death of Queen Elizabeth II ‚Äì and the protocol that the King should visit each realm before other senior royals ‚Äì came into play.",0.72,55,0,55,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,Albanese's progressive patriotism goes international,"From this uncritical mindset came the reductive focus on whether there would be a face-to-face meeting with America's rudest president. Was it all Kevin Rudd's fault for being mean in a past post, some wondered. Australian prestige, perhaps even our national validity, turned exclusively on ""his"" favourable gaze. National puffery as cultural cringe.

  
Poised to strike, opposition frontbenchers inevitably concluded that Trump's non-scheduling of said audience was ""embarrassing"" and a rebuke for not slavishly supporting America on climate, social media, and of course, the unfettered exceptionalism of Israel.  

Embarrassing for whom was never really quantified because this, like much in the absurd theatre of politics, was hollow nonsense. Were we Australians embarrassed as individuals? Hardly.Perhaps then, it was the Prime Minister? Yet he didn't blink, instead offering clarity, and even a spot of derring-do.Pressed by reporters to concede dangerous frictions in Australia's relationship with the administration, he responded forthrightly.""

I'm saying that Australia makes our position clear as a sovereign nation. Our foreign policy isn't determined in Washington, or Beijing, or Wellington for that matter. Our foreign policy is determined around the cabinet table in Canberra.""Whoa! I mean, sure, this is true and all, but surely saying it out loud is, like, poking the bear, right?

My own response was relief. Suddenly, out of an unexpected quadrant, the PM's ""progressive patriotism"" bow had been given a new string.

Symbolically, it recalled the famous shift by wartime prime minister John Curtin in the final days of 1941, who, despite demands from Winston Churchill to defend British interests in Burma, insisted on bringing our troops home to repel the Japanese. Churchill simply refused to comply with this Australian impudence, but in the end, folded.

""Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom,"" Curtin wrote in a newspaper editorial published on December 27 - barely three weeks after Pearl Harbour. It was a turning point in Australia's defence, but also in its international positioning.

Correctly analysing that the entry of Imperial Japan posed an existential threat to Australia, Curtin then used a radio address to Americans in March 1942 to argue that the US had a direct stake in the successful defence of Australia.""

Australia is the last bastion between the west coast of America and the Japanese. If Australia goes, the Americas are wide open,"" he told them.True, these were critical shifts in allegiance made against clear real-time dangers. But it was Curtin's capacity to comprehend emergent dynamics and his willingness to forsake the old architecture of British subordination that made them possible. Even his use of media was innovative.

Self-evidently, Albanese's recent statement in New York was not of comparable weight to Australia's wartime survival, but what Curtin had diagnosed regarding British self-interest in 1941-42, Albanese can see in America's immovable position on Israel in that it has become central to the ongoing problem.

While Albanese wasn't bringing our troops home, there was a sense in his articulation of a distinctively Australian perspective that Labor was drawing our sovereignty home, in the context of a dynamic and more assertively independent foreign policy. How this squares against AUKUS is anyone's guess - much like the pact itself.

Still, the Palestine decision signals a growing confidence within Labor that Trump's America is regarded by Australian voters as, at best, unreliable. Trump's clampdown on dissenting speech, his aggressively partisan valorisation of Christianity, the demonisation of migrants, his flat rejection of climate change as a ""con"", are shredding American values.

This invites the question: can Australia exert more clout if it steps out from America's shadow?This is not entirely new ground. During his initial stint as prime minister, Rudd talked about the creativity and potential of middle-powers. During his own inaugural address to the UN General Assembly in 2008, Rudd leveraged the idea of Australian influence born of an ability to forge multiple relationships that comes from being neither too small to matter, nor one of the dominant powers, such as the US, China, or indeed, NATO.

""Through our membership of the United Nations, we are committed to using creative middle power diplomacy to help overcome the great challenges of our age,"" he said in those more hopeful days.I was in the General Assembly in 2008 when those comments were made. Tabloid analyses either ignored the proposition entirely, or scoffed at the unlikely presumption of exercising global influence outside of American sponsorship.

Now though, even the US is sprinting away from its dominance of the UN, with Trump trashing it in his speech, having spitefully denied visas to the Palestinian delegation. Albanese appears to be open to a reworking of Rudd's possibilities, via a recognition that an enlightened, ""progressive"" patriotism can arise through greater Australian self-confidence and moral consistency internationally. Crucially, this new assertiveness frontally challenges the inherently contradictory claim of the political right to be both more patriotically Australian, while also being unbreakably loyal to America and to Israel, no matter their behaviour.

AustralianPolitics,Australia is behind Latvia on productivity growth,"Australia is fiddling while Rome burns. While I agree with the importance of embracing new technology and social policies, it is a waste of time and money unless we fix the underlying and serious economic problems that are dragging Australia down. The only thing that keeps our economy going is our resources sector, which is often childishly vilified.

Productivity growth should return at least to its pre-COVID rate. We are at the bottom of the OECD list, and even Latvia has a bigger rate of growth. Technology will help (subject to the unions), but it is not the sole cure. Investment in equipment has declined as the industry struggles with the increasing costs of energy, labour and materials and fights its way through the ever-growing red tape at the federal and state levels.



Technology to reduce the cost of materials and labour is part of the solution to the housing crisis.  Steven Siewert

We should set a target for the annual growth in productivity based on our previous high performance and implement policies that practically lift productivity.

For example, the cost of energy and electricity must be lowered quickly, as the threefold increase in the cost of electricity is a growing burden for households. The cost and unreliability of energy are also killing industry. Manufacturing has declined from 13.789 per of GDP to 5.63 per cent of GDP in 2023.

We must return to our previous competitive energy advantage if local manufacturing is to return at least to its previous level. Our self-sufficiency in manufacturing has declined significantly, which is both an economic problem, a strategic threat and a lesson I had hoped we had learned in World War 11.

‚ÄúYou know a government is in trouble if it has to borrow to pay for routine outgoings.‚Äù

Technology cannot solve these problems, but it can help in improving efficiency and competitiveness if we get things going and return to having a thriving industrial base. In addition, the reliability of electricity supply has also declined due to the loss of base load capacity. So-called ‚Äúload shedding‚Äù is code for blackouts of industry. It‚Äôs no wonder our smelters are considering moving offshore, further weakening our manufacturing and self-sufficiency.

Real GDP growth had dropped to 1.3 per cent in 2024-25, the weakest growth rate since the 1990s. We should set a target KPI for the growth in GDP and instigate policies at the federal and state levels to achieve this goal.

The current account deficit is $13.7 billion in the June quarter and is a clear indicator of our economic decline. 2025 has seen the ninth consecutive deficit of our current account. We should set a target based on our previous best performance and, of course, adopt the necessary policies to achieve our goal. Reform in the largest states is also important in achieving this goal.

The budgets of the major states and the federal government must be moved to surplus, and the current huge government debt steadily reduced so that we have the reserves to deal with the next inevitable downturn. We should set targets for expenditure and revenue. You know a government is in trouble if it has to borrow to pay for routine outgoings. Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey achieved this following the Recommendations of the National Commission of Audit.

We must also solve the housing crisis by ensuring supply exceeds demand. Technology to reduce the cost of materials and the ever-rising cost of labour is part of the solution. The main problem is government charges, which are now up to 50 per cent of the cost of a new house in Sydney.

The other major issues are the sclerotic and costly planning systems and red tape at the federal level and in some states. The Commonwealth should reward states that do reform. The recent announcement by NSW Premier Chris Minns and the creation of the Development Coordination Authority is an excellent example of this.

The growing skills shortage is adding to costs and reducing our competitiveness. Increased investment and incentives in education and training, particularly in STEM are essential. Mathematics should be compulsory in the HSC. We are short on engineers, nurses, software engineers, civil and electrical engineers, electricians, other trades and teachers. It is encouraging to see recently how well our high schools and particularly public schools, are performing in NSW, and it demonstrates we can do it.

Household savings fell to 4.2 per cent from 5.3 per cent over 2022-24, an indication of the squeeze on households. Taxing unrealised gains in super certainly does not help.",0.66,35,0,35,en-AU

Donald Trump's UN speech has ignited a Liberal Party 'civil war' in Australia. Artwork: Frank Ling

Conservatism in Australia is engulfed in disruption, chaos and upheaval. It is riven by intellectual division, populist assertion and Trumpian delusion with many of its politicians running personal crusades that further demoralise a Liberal Party struggling for self-preservation.

The May 2025 election wipe-out has unleashed a torrent of experimental vibes from a conservative minority seeking a historical reinvention of the party, demanding a shift to the ideological right with an attack on so-called mass immigration, net zero at 2050 and sharpening cultural battles with Labor.

The Trumpian overtones are everywhere. In his breakouts, frontbencher Andrew Hastie repeatedly uses the enshrining slogan ‚Äúputting Australians first‚Äù ‚Äì selling the idea that Albanese Labor is betraying the people, from climate change to immigration to industry policy.

Donald Trump‚Äôs speech this week to the UN General Assembly ‚Äì pitched as a clarion call to radical conservatives across the Western democracies ‚Äì will inspire the Coalition right wing at home to more assertive demands. This was Trump in his most devastating guise as global prophet seeking to spread his revolution to other countries.

Tony Abbott told Inquirer: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an electrifying speech that Donald Trump has just made. It should reverberate around the world. He‚Äôs right that misguided climate policies and scarcely controlled mass migration are grave threats to the survival of the West.‚Äù

It is the apocalyptic language of Trump ‚Äì American in its quasi-religious tone ‚Äì that excites much of the Coalition base in Australia. Hastie now warns that unless the Liberals get their act together they will ‚Äúbe potentially in further decline and perhaps one day extinct‚Äù. He stages a conservative breakout driven by the view the Liberals are approaching a ‚Äúreform or die‚Äù existential event. This excites and delights the pro-conservative media, anxious to play its role in the liquidation of the moderate Sussan Ley as leader.

One conservative told Inquirer the party‚Äôs future depended on installing a conservative leader before the next election. The obvious candidates are Angus Taylor or Hastie, in a party riven by leadership and factional rivalry.

In a fatalistic move, Hastie has crossed the Rubicon. Despite professing support for Ley, he is undermining her. He believes the core ideas of the Trumpian revolution ‚Äì sovereignty, family, strong borders, energy security and cultural cohesion ‚Äì provide a foundation for mobilisation by the Liberals and growing acceptance by the Australian public.

The central issue for the Liberals now is whether the party‚Äôs centre can hold and the conservative revolution ‚Äì decisively divorced from the Australian middle ground ‚Äì can be contained or accommodated by Ley on acceptable terms. The future of the Liberal Party now depends on this calculation.

Ley is vulnerable but fighting; witness her tough-minded economic speech a fortnight ago that should have been a uniting event, calling for fiscal responsibility, rejecting big government and empowering the individual ‚Äì yet it sank without trace.

The lesson: the pro-conservative media won‚Äôt credit Ley and will promote her removal.

Most of the conservatives are obsessed about ideology but weak on policy. Hastie‚Äôs faith in state power, market scepticism, nostalgia for the car industry and hostility towards emissions reductions represent the policies repudiated and buried by the Liberal Party during the Abbott government 2013-15 under Abbott, Joe Hockey and Mathias Cormann. That‚Äôs how crazy is the current Liberal chaos and intellectual confusion.

Hastie‚Äôs breakout has raised severe doubts about his judgment and his policy ideas, and has left wide sections of the party puzzled and angry. The tensions will only intensify when people realise that Hastie is serious and prepared to contest the leadership this term if the politics break his way.

He believes the West is in a profound civilisational crisis. He wants the Liberal Party to acknowledge this reality and be ready to act on it. Hastie has been influenced by the book Covenant written by Danny Kruger, the British Conservative MP who has just defected to Nigel Farage‚Äôs Reform UK party declaring the Tories have become a ‚Äúroadblock to conservatism‚Äù. Kruger says of the impending crisis: ‚ÄúBut our culture has never before adopted the critique of itself as its governing philosophy. It is difficult to imagine how civilisation that essentially repudiates itself can possibly survive.‚Äù

The ultimate issue is belief: what does the Liberal Party stand for in 2025?

Ley must answer this question and fast. Waiting for policy reviews won‚Äôt work. She doesn‚Äôt have much time. Hastie is set on providing an answer.

Our conservatives are influenced by the global movement. Two defining speeches came this week from Trump at the UN and Abbott himself at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Brisbane. Abbott revealed the depth of alarm about the party‚Äôs future. Speaking to an audience of conservative believers, Abbott apologised for past Liberal failures and delivered a desperate, almost panicked, plea ‚Äì ‚Äúgive us one last chance to prove ourselves worthy of your trust‚Äù ‚Äì his delivery interrupted with audience cheers of ‚ÄúPauline Hanson‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne Nation‚Äù. The Liberals are reduced to begging for far-right redemption.

This is the electoral lever the conservatives will deploy: unless the party goes decisively to the right, the voters will shift decisively to Hanson. Hanson is running ferociously against net zero at 2050, waiting to hoover up these votes. Hastie‚Äôs pitch is that the world has changed, so the Liberals must change ‚Äì this, he says, is the world of Xi Jinping and Trump.

That‚Äôs true. But while Trump exploits genuine flaws in progressive policies, Australia must beware: Trump is an isolationist in his mad assaults on climate change and renewables while his attacks on immigration as a threat to national civilisation are excessive in any Australian context.

Here is a reminder: Australia is not America. Trump usually turns a valid point into an invalid policy prescription. His politics don‚Äôt work in Australia, not now, not ever. Peter Dutton learnt this at the last election, yet many conservatives want a re-run, blind to the character of their own country.

As Abbott suggests, Trump presents as a saviour of the nation-state and of Western civilisation. Progressives loathe Trump but seem incapable of grasping his enduring appeal against everything they represent.

Warning the democratic world, Trump said: ‚ÄúThe carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions and they‚Äôre heading down a path of total destruction. Climate change, it‚Äôs the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.‚Äù He had a White House rule: never use the word coal, only use ‚Äúclean, beautiful coal‚Äù.

On mass migration Trump told UN leaders: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs destroying your country and you have to do something about it ‚Äì the No.1 political issue of our time, the crisis of uncontrolled migration. Your countries are being ruined.‚Äù



President Donald Trump delivered a fiery address at the United Nations in New York, lashing out at the organisation‚Äôs global agenda and accusing it of spreading ‚Äúalarmist‚Äù climate rhetoric. In a defiant hour-long speech, he dismissed climate change as ‚Äúthe greatest con job‚Äù ever perpetrated, condemned uncontrolled migration, and declared that America would chart its own path on the world stage. Breaking from diplomatic convention, President Trump attacked both the UN and his political rivals, underscoring his nationalist vision and rejection of multilateralism.

Much, but not all of this, refers to illegal entry, an issue contained in Australia. But Trump delivered a powerful addition: ‚ÄúProud nations must be allowed to protect their communities and prevent their societies from being overwhelmed by people they have never seen before with different customs, religions, with different everything.‚Äù

Peta Credlin, who speaks directly to the conservative rank and file, said in this paper: ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs speech wasn‚Äôt so much as a salvo as it was a bunker-busting bomb at the very epicentre of a global governance structure that is crippling Western civilisation.‚Äù

Credlin called it a ‚Äúdirect repudiation‚Äù of the two ideas that dominate the West ‚Äì the climate change destruction of national energy sovereignty and barely controlled mass migration ‚Äì ideas that much of the Liberal Party and the British Conservative Party have long accepted.

These are the new battle lines pointing to a conservative revolution. But a revolution going where?



Sky News host Peta Credlin discusses US President Donald Trump‚Äôs speech at the United Nations overnight. ‚ÄúIn a truth bomb designed to burst open the bunker of global bureaucracy and control that is the UN headquarters in New York, Donald Trump‚Äôs speech last night didn‚Äôt miss,‚Äù Ms Credlin said. ‚ÄúIt was a powerful speech designed to not only kill a few woke sacred cows but also to eat them in one of his famous burgers as well. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs clearly decided that he‚Äôs not going to die wondering whether he could‚Äôve made a difference second time around in the White House.‚Äù

The Liberals need a mainstream anchor that accepts the reality of decarbonisation, the need for effective but more limited immigration and an economic policy that rejects pervasive state power and renews individual enterprise.

Ley‚Äôs task is daunting and perhaps it is beyond her. It is to hold the Liberals together, beat back the extremes of the conservative revolution, but still find a way to channel this conservative momentum. The party is vulnerable in urban centres, once its heartland, and unless it appeals to these voters then the fears of marginalisation will be realised.

The mistake the conservatives keep making is their Trumpian insistence that the Liberals must seek maximum differentiation from Labor. Their real task, on the contrary, is to understand and reflect the Australian mainstream in its many different manifestations. Conservative echo chambers are the great distraction. In his interview with this paper done from Washington in mid-September, Liberal frontbencher Dan Tehan, in charge of the energy and net zero review, offered a decisive pointer to the resolution of this internal party crisis. It seems to run as follows: nuclear is the key, in the US micro-reactors off an assembly line are now being planned to power data centres for AI, funded by huge private capital injections, with the Australian government able to take a supervisory golden share in operations.

It‚Äôs a new dynamic. The old Dutton nuclear plan goes. There are no government-constructed nuclear plants at old coal sites. There is no huge call on the public budget. The aim is to destroy any Labor scare campaign on public cost, as seen at the last election, while selling the idea that net zero can be achieved only with nuclear and that it will be cheaper than Labor‚Äôs model. In America the AI revolution, with its massive demand for energy, is already being tied into huge private investment in micro-reactors.

The plan is to roll out asap independent costings of Labor‚Äôs model and, down the track, the Coalition‚Äôs nuclear-oriented model. This reflects two essential strategic conclusions ‚Äì that the Coalition must walk down the decarbonisation path and that it must devise a superior net-zero model to Labor. The plan is to give the Coalition a policy window to the future, not the past.

Ley has already said the Coalition will not legislate for net zero. Decoded, it will not mandate net zero. This provides flexibility to facilitate an internal political settlement. The hard line conservatives won‚Äôt buy this settlement. Hastie has been unwise enough to paint himself into a corner saying that unless net zero is rejected he goes to the backbench. Yet Ley cannot repudiate net zero, nor should a rational Liberal partyroom.

It is disappointing that Abbott in his CPAC speech has reversed his position and called on the Coalition to drop the Morrison government policy of net zero at 2050, since just a few weeks ago he dismissed the debate, telling the author it was best to avoid theological issues. Now he hasn‚Äôt.

He told the conservative audience of net zero: ‚ÄúWe have got to be against it.‚Äù Abbott wants the Liberals to stage yet another political war over climate change, saying they prevailed with this tactic at the 2010, 2013 and 2019 elections.

Beyond this Abbott offered a civilisational pitch for a new aggressive conservatism: ‚ÄúOur society is fragmenting. We have three flags, not one. Some 80 Labor-Green councils are refusing to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. We have too many migrants and too many of them are living in Hotel Australia rather than joining Team Australia. And yet you can hardly blame them when we have a left establishment which is embarrassed about our Anglo-Celtic core culture and does not like our Judaeo-Christian ethos ‚Äì even though it‚Äôs these things that have made us great.‚Äù



Former prime minister Tony Abbott has labelled the Albanese government's climate targets a political death warrant. The former PM is calling on the Liberals to drop support for net zero as the Coalition continues to stay divided over the issue. Speaking at CPAC Australia, Mr Abbott was pessimistic about Labor's climate target and warned of the potential consequences of chasing it. Mr Abbott claims the government is 'pedalling a false environmental apocalypse' and questioned the reliability of renewable energy.

Abbott is broadly allied with Hastie but certainly not on board with everything Hastie says. That‚Äôs understandable given the pitches Hastie has made. On energy, Hastie, in an astonishing line, says he wants a price target. Taken at face value that can only mean replacing an emissions target and rejecting the Paris Agreement framework of emissions reduction targets. The emissions reduction targets approved by the Abbott government in 2015 ran through the Turnbull and Morrison governments.

Hastie‚Äôs critique of former Labor and Liberal governments, claiming they ‚Äúlet us down in the past by letting the car industry disappear‚Äù, is equally astonishing and untenable. Having the courage to end subsidies to an uncompetitive car industry is one of Abbott‚Äôs proudest economic achievements as prime minister. His famous line about the car companies was: ‚ÄúI said we were not going to chase them down the street waving a cheque book at them.‚Äù

Governments these days have a strategic role to play in industry policy. But Hastie‚Äôs limited ventures into policy by backing energy price targets and lamenting the loss of uncompetitive, government-subsidised industry, raise alarming signals about a retreat to the failed policies of the 1970s. Ley, backed by her key shadow economic ministers, Ted O‚ÄôBrien in Treasury and James Paterson in finance, needs to get on the front foot, repudiate false ideas and keep articulating the economic principles that will guide the Liberal Party. While Hastie is rapidly becoming the darling of the pro-conservative media, his ideas loom as throwbacks to the past, not beacons to the future.

Hastie has spent 10 years preparing for his breakout: a decade as a backbencher, never a minister in the previous Coalition government and a term in what he felt was an opposition straitjacket imposed by Dutton. On display now are his ideological resolution, leadership ambition and political inexperience. The conservative spearheads, Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price are remarkable political assets to be mobilised for the Liberal Party. The question is whether their visions for the party can be accommodated within a relatively united centre-right Liberal Party.

It‚Äôs true we now live in an age of populist politics and that‚Äôs a new ball game ‚Äì witness the US and the Britain today ‚Äì but there is no escaping the need to fashion policies that actually work and advance the country, not just represent a justified cultural attack on the centre-left.

Reflecting the orthodoxy, former Howard chief of staff and Liberal minister Arthur Sinodinos, alarmed at the disunity, had a crack on the ABC this week about the conservatives and the need for rational politics, saying: ‚ÄúWhat all these people should be doing on the frontbench, on the backbench of the Liberal Party, is putting their heads down and getting on with coming up with specific policies and keeping the government to account.‚Äù

What prospect of this?

Abbott is both a romantic and a brutal realist. In his interview with Inquirer this week, he highlighted the dilemma facing conservatives who are enthralled by Trump but recognise that he cannot be easily translated into Australia. Abbott said: ‚ÄúMAGA plays well in the American heartland, but it won‚Äôt translate to Australia. Each country is going to have to find its own way to deal with these issues, given our different circumstances and different institutional cultures.‚Äù",0.76,18,0,18,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,Anthony Albanese reveals his plan for long-term power,"Five months into his second term as Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese is thinking not just about the next election due in 2028 but the one after that, too. Having won a thumping re-election victory on May 3 with 94 seats in parliament, leaving the Liberal Party existentially challenged and internally divided, he says his ultimate ambition is for Labor to become ‚Äúthe natural party of government‚Äù in Australia.

It is a goal he says he believes is in reach, but only if the party and government he leads are clear about who they represent, what they stand for and what they want to achieve. Albanese, only the third Labor leader to win back-to-back elections, and reinforced with a huge parliamentary majority, is not about to risk it all with a crazy-brave agenda, exceeding his mandate or rushing to reform.

His message ‚Äì to voters, his party and ministers ‚Äì is that Labor‚Äôs longevity depends as much on its policies as it does on its processes. Unity is expected. Stability is essential. A methodical, systematic, process-driven cabinet-led approach is required. While responsiveness is demanded by governments, more than ever, Albanese is thinking long term. He is, above all, a strategist.

‚ÄúI said before the 2022 election, I had a plan for the first term and the next term looking forward, that I wanted Labor to be the natural party of government, and that means responding in a commonsense way,‚Äù Albanese says, relaxing into a lounge at Kirribilli House, framed by a stunning Sydney Harbour view, loosening the tie around his neck and neatly folding it.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I mean by bringing people with you on that journey of change as a progressive centre-left government that doesn‚Äôt try to do everything immediately but which shapes that change and that agenda going forward.‚Äù

He is talking exclusively to Inquirer ahead of a visit to the US, Britain and United Arab Emirates with an ambitious foreign policy agenda to prosecute: recognition of Palestine, a bid for a UN Security Council seat, international action on climate change, Australia‚Äôs initiative to protect children online, encouraging freer trade and investment in manufacturing and clean energy.

The Prime Minister had no expectation of a bilateral meeting with Donald Trump in New York but they came face-to-face for the first time at a UN reception for leaders. Albanese described it as ‚Äúvery warm and engaging‚Äù. A selfie was taken. They discussed a scheduled meeting at the White House next month. Albanese, according to a senior government figure, told Trump: ‚ÄúWe will do good things together.‚Äù

Albanese rejects suggestions the alliance has been harmed by the delayed meeting. He met Joe Biden several times. He is delivering the $368bn AUKUS submarine agreement. The US footprint in Australia expands at a rapid rate with defence installations, marines, joint exercises and plans to host US submarines, planes and ships. No Labor prime minister has been so accommodating of the US presence on our shores.

The recognition of Palestine with provisos that Israel is recognised, democratic elections are held and Hamas excluded from governing is not welcomed by the US but has the support of Britain, France and Canada, and most other nations. Albanese, challenged on how it will deliver peace to the conflict-strewn region, says he moved carefully, cautiously and in concert with other Western nations. It is about inching towards peace with a message of hope.

The government has set its 2035 climate change target, a range of 62-70 per cent reduction on 2005 emissions, in accordance with scientific and economic advice. It is another example of steering a middle path, winning the support of unions and business. That the polar extremes of the climate change debate ‚Äì the Greens on the left and Coalition on the right ‚Äì said it was not enough or too much underscores his middle path.

‚ÄúThe first term was not just defined by what we did but how we did it,‚Äù Albanese says. ‚ÄúTerm one was turning the corner from an inflationary environment in order to lift living standards. In a sentence: what we needed to do to create those preconditions. Term two is building on that agenda further for setting Australia up for the decades ahead.‚Äù

On the eve of the May 2022 election, Albanese told me he wanted to change the ‚Äúmind and mood‚Äù of the country he sought to lead. He believes they have changed. After the revolving-door prime ministership that defined the Coalition (2013-22) in power and the concomitant partyroom showdowns, policy backflips, secret ministries, culture wars and confrontational approach, voters had had enough.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the things that wasn‚Äôt picked up by some of the commentary in the lead-up to May 3,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey underestimated the way that people felt about the direction of the country and I think people have respected the fact that it is an orderly government. People who might disagree with it know that we have engaged with them. They know that we don‚Äôt shout at them, and I think there‚Äôs a lot of shouting in global politics at the moment.

‚ÄúWe have built, I think, good relations with a majority of the business community, the union movement, civil society groups ‚Äì we are seen as approachable. That doesn‚Äôt mean they agree, you know, with everything, but there is a consistency, I think, about what we bring to the task of government.‚Äù Albanese adds that he leads a ‚Äúpragmatic, sensible but principled‚Äù government.

The polls were not encouraging in the summer of 2024-25. But Albanese believed voters would respond not only to his policies but also the style of governing. Still, he had to claw back support and he did that at the start of the year with a sweep through marginal electorates, supporting local candidates and making pledges, from the far north to the west, south to Tasmania, and in the pivotal states of NSW and Victoria.

He judged opposition leader Peter Dutton to be ‚Äúvery confident‚Äù of victory, which made the latter ‚Äúcomplacent‚Äù. Albanese was in campaign mode in the first week of January. ‚ÄúThey were still in the sheds, you know, when the second half was on.‚Äù The victory, however, was not only due to the campaign but also to the pillars of policy that had been erected during the previous three years.

‚ÄúThe first challenge is always the economy and dealing with cost-of-living pressures,‚Äù he says of Labor‚Äôs first term. ‚ÄúIt was not anticipated that there would be such global inflationary pressures and the biggest energy crisis since the 1970s. So, we had to deal with people‚Äôs immediate concerns whilst trying to anticipate and create longer-term reform agendas.‚Äù

He notes energy price relief, cheaper medicines, childcare subsidies and redesigning legislated income tax cuts to benefit those on low and middle incomes. Every state signed up to the Gonski education reforms. Real wages increased, paid parental leave was extended, 10 days‚Äô domestic and family violence leave were initiated. And the government legislated a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, but reaching that goal will be a stretch.

Foreign policy is always a prime ministerial priority but it will be more so in a second term. The UN Security Council bid underlines Albanese‚Äôs global ambition for Australia to be seen as a constructive, innovative and respected nation abroad.

Albanese says ‚Äúre-engagement and repairing the relationship with China‚Äù was necessary for export industries and jobs. He refers to the ‚Äúre-engagement‚Äù with Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries and the support provided to Ukraine to resist Russian aggression. And ‚Äúengagement‚Äù in international forums on climate change.

The mention of not signing the mooted defence treaty with Papua New Guinea or finalising the security agreement with Vanuatu prompts a sharp response. In relation to PNG, he bristles at over-reactive commentary, says there is a process that will be followed and insists the defence treaty will be signed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all nonsense,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all done. The words are agreed.‚Äù

Before leading Labor back to power 3¬Ω years ago, Albanese insisted the lessons of the Rudd-Gillard government had been learnt: namely, the internal divisions, rivalry and backstabbing in which two of its prime ministers ‚Äì Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard ‚Äì were both cut down by caucus in a whirlwind of ambition and retribution.

Moreover, his ministers come to the cabinet table, sit in caucus and deal with departments with the experience of having done it before. Albanese says he has personally presided over caucus renewal, spotting candidates and ensuring younger MPs are promoted, and boasts that more than 50 per cent of MPs in caucus are women.

‚ÄúWe have had experienced ministers but we are also having new people come in,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe have had, which you need, some renewal and we have an incredible capacity coming up through the ranks. We have a clear ideological position going forward as well. There is a great deal of consensus. Does not mean that everyone agrees on every issue but there is very broad agreement.‚Äù

Before the 2022 election, Labor MPs waxed lyrical about another lesson learnt from another Labor government: the need for proper cabinet government, with robust debates behind closed doors and listening to and respecting public service advice, that was a hallmark of the Hawke-Keating government. A difference, though, is that there were sharp ideological differences in the party then that required careful management.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen the Labor Party so united as it is,‚Äù Albanese says. ‚ÄúSome of the old ideological divides in the party have just disappeared.‚Äù He expands on this point: ‚ÄúWe have an ideology, but it is one in which there is a great deal of consensus across the Labor Party that people don‚Äôt go into a room with the left hat on or a right hat on. People go in with the Labor hat.‚Äù

Albanese, who joined the Labor Party in 1979 amid the Cold War, witnessed and indeed participated in rowdy conference debates over totemic issues such as the US alliance, market-based economic policies, reforms to education funding, and uranium mining and export. These were no-holds-barred, tear-them-down-and-drag-them-out ideological battles.

But those days are over. The rise of 24-hour television news and social media does not permit it. It would be mutual destruction to see, in real time, ministers and party members in tribal combat mode. The party is still highly factional but without the deep ideological divide.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a real understanding of the Labor Party, the machine structure culture, probably as much as anyone who‚Äôs ever been in this position,‚Äù Albanese says.

The party today, he says, has as a guiding star: no one left behind, no one held back.

‚ÄúWe are a social justice party that will always look after the vulnerable,‚Äù he says.

It is about closing the gap for Indigenous Australians, making the National Disability Insurance Scheme sustainable, expanding Medicare and GP services, supporting gender equality and human rights, and ‚Äúrespecting people for who they are‚Äù.

The ‚Äúno one held back‚Äù speaks to ‚Äúaspiration and opportunity‚Äù with reward for effort and encouragement of entrepreneurialism, a progressive taxation system and education supported at all levels: early childhood, school, trades and university.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs broad support for a market-based economy, but one that also recognises that where market failure occurs a government has a responsibility to intervene,‚Äù he says.

On the first anniversary of his prime ministership, Albanese told me he saw himself and his government as a change agent. It was not in power merely to preside but to fundamentally alter Australia‚Äôs policy settings. He embraced the ‚Äúinterventionist‚Äù description but applied systematically, where needed and warranted, to deliver better outcomes.

Robert Menzies spoke of the need for the Liberal Party in the 1940s to appeal to voters in the middle ground who cherished freedom, choice and enterprise but also valued security and opportunity. These values of security and opportunity are now identified with and were given new meaning by Labor with its defence of public services during the election campaign.

Medicare provides security. Reducing student debt provides opportunity. Not raiding superannuation to afford a home provides security. Backing action on climate change is not only necessary but about security and opportunity. Higher wages, income tax cuts and workplace flexibility are about opportunity.

The Coalition, in contrast, promised to cut public service jobs and end work from home, and opposed student debt relief. It looked mean and nasty. Culture wars on flags, welcome to country ceremonies and promises to reform a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù curriculum seemed provocatively divisive and positively Trumpian. Voters under 50, women and migrants, especially, deserted the Liberal Party. Albanese‚Äôs re-election victory, however, masks Labor‚Äôs support in the electorate. The primary vote was 34.5 per cent. ‚ÄúOur primary vote still isn‚Äôt what we would want it to be,‚Äù Albanese concedes. But the two-party vote increased to 55.2 per cent. That is historically high. Labor‚Äôs vote went up in the Senate. And the seat haul ranks among the highest of any government. Moreover, Labor maintains a commanding lead over the Coalition in all polls after the election. If an election were held today, Labor would increase its seat tally. The Liberal Party would shrink even smaller.

Politics is relative. The Liberal Party, to its right, had its worst defeat since 1943. The party has all but vanished in metropolitan Australia. It has no pathway back to power unless it regains teal seats in its traditional heartland. It regained one (Goldstein) but lost one (Bradfield).

The Greens, to Labor‚Äôs left, lost three seats and its leader, Adam Bandt.

‚ÄúIn a two-party system, the decline of one helps to reinforce, I think, where we are at,‚Äù Albanese says. ‚ÄúThe Labor Party is now the biggest party. It has more seats in regional and remote Australia than any other political party.‚Äù He says Labor‚Äôs margins in many seats it won in 2022 have been strengthened after the last election.

A big majority, Albanese says, must not be taken for granted. The focus this term must be on keeping faith with election commitments. He recalls that because the party won 94 seats, there were suggestions that ‚Äúnow we can do what we want‚Äù from some in the party. His response? ‚ÄúNo. Now we have to deliver what we said we would do.‚Äù

It has been a busy first six months.

‚ÄúWe made sure that on July 1 we had the paid parental leave, the super on paid parental leave, the energy rebates, the paid prac for students,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúWe legislated, as we said we would, the 20 per cent reduction in student debt. We‚Äôve brought forward the 5 per cent deposits on housing to October.‚Äù

There is still an underbelly of discontent in pockets of Australia that has spilled into city streets. Since the election, there have been protests about the Israel-Hamas war, Indigenous sovereignty rallies and marches against immigration. There have been anti-Semitic attacks. Neo-Nazis have clashed with other protesters and police.

‚ÄúSocial media pushes people, polarises people,‚Äù Albanese says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge wake-up call about people being pushed to extremes and to believe things as fact that are not fact.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúThe solution to that is to provide commonsense, straightforward policy and political leadership that isn‚Äôt angry, that isn‚Äôt full of hyperbole.‚Äù

Albanese is trying to lower the temperature. He mentions the strong stance he has taken condemning anti-Semitic attacks. He has invited Jewish and Palestinian community leaders to the Lodge for private talks. He regularly meets multicultural community organisations. He has met farmers and addressed the News Corp Bush Summit. He listens to and respects people even if they disagree.

Being prime minister changes a person. Nobody comes to the job fully formed. Albanese says he has been talking to Paul Keating ‚Äì Labor‚Äôs elder statesman ‚Äì about the nature of the job, the burden of responsibility and obligation that carries with it, and how nobody can know what it is like until you have done it.

‚ÄúYou grow as a person,‚Äù Albanese says. ‚ÄúYou engage more with a whole range of people. When I sit down now and have either face-to-face or regular conversations with people who are other leaders, world leaders, that has an impact.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very well organised personally,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúMy own personal upbringing is part of that ‚Ä¶ I was helping to run a household at a very young age, often by myself, you know, as a young teen, so I‚Äôm very well organised. You just get better.‚Äù

Albanese says he is thinking about the job non-stop. He uses time on planes to write notes that help him get a broader perspective on things. He is mindful of the need to exercise ‚Äì still plays in the Marrickville tennis competition ‚Äì but laments not seeing friends enough.

‚ÄúYou give up things in this job,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy biggest critic could not say that I don‚Äôt work hard. You‚Äôve got to be making a difference, having an impact, you know, not just occupying the space.‚Äù

Asked how long he wants to be prime minister or if he has a time in mind for an exit, Albanese responds that he will continue as long as he thinks he is the ‚Äúbest person‚Äù to lead the party and the government.

‚ÄúThe idea that I went into parliament to be leader is absurd,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have that expectation or that desire. In 2019, I was very confident because I thought that I was the best person then to (lead the party) and I‚Äôd thought a lot about how we could win (in 2022).

‚ÄúAs long as I think I‚Äôm the best person to be in the leadership of the party, then I‚Äôm here. And as long as I‚Äôm enjoying it, too. And, you know, I am enjoying it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge each and every day. But it‚Äôs an incredible privilege to be able to do it.‚Äù

The radical firebrand who spoke of the urgency and necessity of democratic socialism in his youth is now a process-driven, methodical, pragmatic, incrementalist, as ever reformist, but determined to lead a united and stable party. Being ‚Äúunderestimated‚Äù, he says, suits him just fine. Especially as his ambition is to lead a long-term Labor government.",0.76,79,0,79,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,"If not here, where? Challenge for NIMBY Greens to support more housing","**PAYWALL:**

As tempers flared at a town hall discussion about an ambitious housing plan for Sydney‚Äôs inner west, one opponent of the proposed 30,000 new homes took umbrage at the label of NIMBYs, insisting they were actually BIMBYs, who simply wanted Better in My Backyard.

Across Australia, governments are setting ambitious goals for new dwellings and with them pressure is increasing on those within communities opposing development to explain what, exactly, better would look like. If not here, then where?

NSW Housing Minister Rose Jackson says the question is most acute for the Greens, who she labels a ‚Äúhindrance‚Äù to new housing for ‚Äúconsistently‚Äù opposing many of the Minns government‚Äôs initiatives, even when they will boost social and affordable housing.

‚ÄúThe rhetoric you hear about wanting housing is entirely unmatched by their actual behaviour at a project by project level, \[and for\] the solutions that would be based in their communities,‚Äù Jackson told the AFR Weekend.

The Greens brand is built on environmental policies. But more recently it has campaigned hard on housing affordability across all levels of government. Ousted federal MP Max Chandler-Mather was the most high-profile advocate on behalf of young people unable to afford a home but state MPs such as Kobi Shetty, the member for Balmain, as well as many Greens councillors in NSW have vowed to fix the housing crisis.

Yet ministers such as Jackson paint a different picture. She cites the NSW government‚Äôs redevelopment of Waterloo, just a few kilometres south of Sydney‚Äôs CBD and serviced by a Metro line, where Labor plans to turn 750 social homes into 3000 dwellings: 1500 market homes and 1500 affordable and social homes as an example of Green hypocrisy.

Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong has described the project as a ‚Äúhuge blow‚Äù to the community, arguing the plan amounts to a partial privatisation of what is purely public housing.

Leong claims the housing minister ‚Äúcan‚Äôt comprehend why evicting 750 households is a huge blow to a tight-knit community‚Äù and says labelling public housing tenants fighting to stay in their homes as NIMBYs is ‚Äúbaseless political rhetoric‚Äù.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre desperate to distract the community from their countless broken promises and total abandonment of any pretence of being different from the Liberals when it comes to demolishing public homes and privatising public land,‚Äù she said.

But Jackson notes the government is doubling the number of affordable and social homes, and argues that mixed-tenure housing ‚Äì combining social, affordable and private market housing ‚Äì is more functional and effective than 100 per cent public housing.

‚ÄúI cannot understand why the Greens think this is objectionable ‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs not something they can get behind, then what is?‚Äù

On Wentworth Park Road in Glebe, the NSW government proposes turning what Jackson describes as 17 ‚Äúdingy, old, not disability-accessible‚Äù social housing units into 43 modern homes, all remaining in public hands.

In August 2023, Shetty wrote to Jackson presenting a petition with 430 signatures opposing the development.

Shetty accuses Jackson of trying to ‚Äúrewrite history‚Äù on the project, ignoring an alternative proposal developed by Hector Abrahams Architects for an additional 16 single-bedroom dwellings while retaining two- to three-bedroom dwellings for families.

‚ÄúThis would have aligned closely with the government‚Äôs target for boosting housing on this site, without needlessly evicting vulnerable people,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúI worked alongside Shelter NSW, local community groups and public housing advocates to push for a plan that would ensure public housing tenants weren‚Äôt evicted from their homes and torn away from their community in the middle of a housing crisis.‚Äù

Shetty has also been actively opposing the Inner West Council‚Äôs Fairer Future housing plan. On July 1, she wrote to Labor mayor Darcy Byrne calling on him to extend consultation and defer consideration of the plan for an ‚Äúappropriate length of time‚Äù, which Byrne labels an indefinite suspension.

**Greens‚Äô constituencies split**

The Greens rely on at least two distinct constituencies: older environmentalists more likely to own their own home and oppose what they argue is inappropriate density; and younger progressives more likely to rent and increasingly being squeezed out of places like Sydney‚Äôs inner west.

The tension between the two played out at Monday‚Äôs Inner West Council meeting, as odd alliances developed between older NIMBYs and young socialists opposed to the Fairer Future plan, and younger YIMBYs including some Greens-voting environmentalists backing Labor‚Äôs housing plan.

The Greens have tried to craft policies that appeal to both groups of supporters, such as the demand for 30 per cent of new homes in upzoned areas to be affordable. But in Sydney‚Äôs inner west, such a policy would render development totally unfeasible or result in towers of up to 40 storeys even if only 10 per cent of dwellings were required to be affordable.

Inner West Greens councillor Izabella Antoniou uses social media to deride the ‚Äúmyth of feasibility‚Äù that developers need to make a profit to build more homes.

‚ÄúFor the Greens, and huge swathes of the community ‚Äì this debate is about not letting this \[local environment plan\] be a Labor-led project that paves the way for the NSW Labor government‚Äôs abdication of their responsibility for the housing crisis to the private market,‚Äù Antoniou tells AFR Weekend.

‚ÄúWe can do density well in the inner city, but it needs to be supported with infrastructure and services, green space and solar access. Developers will make massive profits from these changes: in exchange, they need to be forced to build for community need ‚Äì not their own bottom line.‚Äù

Antoniou says the housing debate ‚Äúis about more than just a dwelling target number; it‚Äôs about raising expectations on what is politically possible. We don‚Äôt have to accept crumbs.‚Äù

But Jackson argues ‚Äúfeasibility isn‚Äôt a myth‚Äù. Given Australia‚Äôs housing market is a mixed market with most homes delivered by the private market ‚Äúclearly development must be feasible to actually occur‚Äù.

**Greens‚Äô opposition ‚ÄòMarxist‚Äô**

Asked for alternatives of where to put public housing, Antoniou and other Greens proffer three dive sites ‚Äì sites used for tunnel construction for the Westconnex motorway ‚Äì along Parramatta Road in Camperdown, Ashfield and Haberfield.

Jackson says the government‚Äôs developer Landcom is already working on the Camperdown site and a second is under consideration for social and affordable housing. The Greens welcomed the announcement but want it to deliver 100 per cent public housing.

Jackson says Australia is ‚Äúnot a Marxist country‚Äù. The NSW government has tipped more than $5 billion into public housing but ‚Äúwon‚Äôt deliver 100 per cent public housing on every site, in every community in Sydney‚Äù.

‚ÄúA lot of young people aren‚Äôt eligible for public housing. The Greens‚Äô position is preposterous.‚Äù

Jackson accuses the Greens of constantly shifting the goalposts, either because they are ‚Äúinternally captured by a rearguard NIMBY group, or \[because\] they are generally obstructive and difficult for their own political opportunistic reasons‚Äù.

‚ÄúThere will always be something ‚Äì because it‚Äôs actually not about having new homes delivered. It‚Äôs like a version of the dog whistle to established home owners, for who scarce housing works very well,‚Äù she says, because it keeps values high.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äòour community is closed‚Äô and pull up the shutters. They don‚Äôt want to sound greedy or that they‚Äôre trying to exclude people. Maybe they believe that‚Äôs not what they are.

‚ÄúBut there is an unfortunate tendency to not recognise the huge social cost and impact on younger generations \[of higher prices\]. I think it‚Äôs great the conversation is changing ‚Äì younger people are speaking up and speaking out.‚Äù",0.61,16,0,16,en-AU

# Ruthlessly effective‚Äô: The Morrison lieutenant behind Ley‚Äôs leadership

When Sussan Ley won the leadership ballot on May 10, days after her party‚Äôs historic election defeat, observers put her numbers down to one source: Alex Hawke.

Ever since the 2022 election loss of his former ally, Scott Morrison, Hawke has been waiting to regain the influence that was once a given in the party. Over three decades, he has been described as a ‚Äúpolitical animal‚Äù, a¬†‚Äúhenchman‚Äù and the ‚Äúultimate faceless man‚Äù, but the centre-right powerbroker is almost always on top.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the best political operator in the Liberal Party, bar none,‚Äù a senior moderate Liberal source tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*.

‚ÄúNo one understands machine politics like Alex Hawke. He‚Äôs disciplined, he‚Äôs smart and he‚Äôs ruthlessly effective ‚Ä¶ Alex understands the importance of providing loyalty and support to the leader, and he‚Äôs doing that for Sussan for the good of the party.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one you‚Äôd rather have in your corner than Alex Hawke when it comes to numbers.‚Äù

Hawke has been in and out of favour with various leaders over the past few terms, having been a minister for Malcolm Turnbull and Morrison‚Äôs key lieutenant before being sent to the back bench by Peter Dutton.

Often working behind the scenes, Hawke was recently in the headlines following his attempts to contain Jacinta Nampijinpa Price‚Äôs comments on Indian voters. The Northern Territory senator accused Hawke of berating her staff, which she described as ‚Äúcowardly and inappropriate‚Äù. Hawke insists he was acting of his own accord, not at Ley‚Äôs request.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the opponent‚Äôs attack? I‚Äôm not doing that here. I did it on my own,‚Äù Hawke tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*. In an interview conducted in the wake of Price‚Äôs actions, he insists he had a high opinion of Price but says that was diminished by the breach of confidence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve helped Coalition figures senior and junior for 30 years. I‚Äôve maintained all those confidences. I could give you 10 explosive stories today, but I‚Äôve never done that, have I, Karen? I have never rung and said, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs 10¬†explosive stories about the Liberal Party.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù

Hawke‚Äôs rationale for jumping into the fray with Price is pragmatic. Colleagues say he is not much interested in policy, but he always has an eye to politics. The party he sees winning elections is not the party of Price, who later insisted she is not racist.

‚ÄúThe No.‚Äâ1 thing is, in modern Australia, you can‚Äôt be a racist party or a racist movement and get elected. So, I‚Äôm insistent on that,‚Äù Hawke tells¬†*The Saturday Paper.*

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit of a contradiction because I‚Äôm a conservative, a right-winger, but I‚Äôve never had a racist bone in my body. I grew up in Western Sydney. Half my mates are Indians. They‚Äôre just Australians that have Indian background and, like, this dichotomy we‚Äôre having ‚Äì a Liberal Party between an older generation that wants to rewind the clock‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe clock‚Äôs never going to rewind. Australia‚Äôs moved on, and that‚Äôs the real thing that‚Äôs going on here. So there is a real moral cause here and it has got to be clear.‚Äù

Absorbed by politics for most of his life, Hawke first grasped his conservative leanings while at school. He lost his first class election and was so intent on winning the next that he rigged the ballot. In his first speech to parliament, he said this was a time when ‚Äúpolitical correctness was at its height, after 12¬†years of Labor rule‚Äù.

A 2005 article for¬†*The Monthly*¬†dug into his ascent to the position of national president of the Young Liberals. The precocious Hawke admitted it was lonely being the only ‚Äúvery right-wing‚Äù kid in his class.

He joined the Liberal Party and the Army Reserve straight out of high school, at the same time as he enrolled in a bachelor of arts at the University of Sydney. He followed this with a master‚Äôs of government and public affairs, before leaping into New South Wales politics, notably assisting and being mentored by the ultra-conservative kingmaker David Clarke and becoming president of the state branch of the Young Liberals.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very addictive, politics,‚Äù Hawke told¬†*The Monthly*¬†20 years ago. ‚ÄúIt is like a habit.‚Äù

Described in the article by fellow young Liberals as future leadership material if he ‚Äúlearns to keep the squabbling under wraps‚Äù, Hawke indicated he could be quite happy to stay in the background.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in being influential in politics in Australia for good, for the cause I believe in. Do I have to be in parliament to do that? I understand completely that I do not. Maybe I will, but that‚Äôs not necessary,‚Äù Hawke said. ‚ÄúIn fact, in some ways it‚Äôs more fun on the outside. It gives you more power.‚Äù

This period in the NSW Young Liberals was marked by a distinctive shift to the right and allegations of branch stacking, with a sign-up surge by young Catholics, including members of the secretive Opus Dei. Hawke is not a member of Opus Dei and nor is Clarke, who describes himself as a ‚Äúcooperator‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe had large membership growth and I‚Äôm very proud of that,‚Äù Hawke told¬†*The Sydney Morning Herald*¬†in 2004.

Clarke and Hawke fell out in the period after Hawke clinched preselection for the north-western Sydney federal seat of Mitchell and won it decisively despite the ‚ÄúRuddslide‚Äù of 2007. By this stage, Hawke‚Äôs ruthlessness was well known. In 2005, when he was still only 28 and a staffer, Hawke was named by then NSW Liberal leader John Brogden as being responsible for his resignation.

In 2010, as Hawke changed allegiances, he tried to oust Clarke ahead of the 2011 state election. Clarke survived preselection at a particularly boisterous Baulkham Hills branch meeting, due to the intervention of soon-to-be premier Barry O‚ÄôFarrell, who was in no mood for a factional blow-up.

‚ÄúAlex tried to take out the big dog, take him into the forest and tried to put a couple of political bullets in ‚Ä¶ and he missed,‚Äù a senior party source tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*. ‚ÄúAnd David Clarke won by a handful of votes.‚Äù

Meanwhile, in Canberra, Hawke was becoming more of a ‚Äúpragmatic Liberal‚Äù and formed his centre-right or ‚Äúsoft-right‚Äù faction. It is a grouping that signed up the member for Cook, Scott Morrison, who entered parliament at the same time as Hawke.

Hawke was integral to the manoeuvring that ended Turnbull‚Äôs prime ministership and elevated his ally to the leadership over Peter Dutton.

Amid all the chaos in 2018, the Morrison allies voted tactically in spills to undermine Turnbull and give a false sense of confidence to Dutton. ‚ÄúHe just wants his people in the party room that he can tell what to do, and that was critical for getting Morrison up as prime minister,‚Äù a senior party source tells¬†*The ¬†Saturday Paper*.

‚ÄúIt was only four or five votes that he had, but the four or five votes were put behind the expulsion, the spill motion, and then they were moved to Morrison. He was enough to change the outcome.‚Äù

Another Liberal calls Hawke a ‚Äúcold-blooded factional killer‚Äù.

The Right faction source adds: ‚ÄúWhen it does come to his number-counting and all that kind of stuff, he‚Äôs actually pretty forensic. He‚Äôs pretty phenomenal. That should be 20¬†per cent of who you are, not 80.

‚ÄúYes, these things are things that are consequences of being involved in politics. They‚Äôre not the reason you‚Äôre there.‚Äù

With Hawke as the factional organiser in NSW, the group was led by Morrison as prime minister and included the now departed Stuart Robert, Steve Irons and Hollie Hughes, as well as an overlapping faith-based ‚Äúprayer group‚Äù that counted some members of the hard right.

The logjam in the state division over delayed federal candidate preselections, according to the 2022 Liberal election review, was a ‚Äúcontributing factor to the party underperforming in some electorates‚Äù. Hawke was Morrison‚Äôs representative on the panel reviewing preselections and it is well documented that he was not turning up to the nomination review committee.

‚ÄúThat was ScoMo trying to engender a captain‚Äôs pick to delay preselections for as long as possible and Alex Hawke was the weapon that he used to do that,‚Äù the senior party source says.

It later led to a state council vote to expel Hawke from the party, which he survived, but sources say it was not a walkover.

‚ÄúWhen a big chunk of the Liberal Party hates you, then you have to ask yourself, well, what is his motivation?‚Äù the party source says.

What holds the party together is the combination of the moderates, or the Photios faction, named for former NSW state minister Michael Photios, and the centre right. A moderate Liberal source tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*, ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre together, then they can outvote the hard right.‚Äù

‚ÄúHard-right NSW ‚Äì Taylor‚Äôs the leader there, although he pretends not to be and says, ‚ÄòOh no, I hate the factions.‚Äô Yeah, right,‚Äù the source says, referring to leadership hopeful and shadow minister for defence Angus Taylor.

Labor‚Äôs 2022 defeat of Morrison and the May 3 thrashing of Dutton has reduced the size of Hawke‚Äôs centre-right faction but not its influence.

‚ÄúWith a small faction, he has been able to have an outsized role on the conservative side of politics in a way that the leaders of other bigger factions can only dream of,‚Äù the senior moderate source says.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a retail politician, but his skill set is just so well equipped for getting outcomes.‚Äù

Hawke‚Äôs time on the back bench under Dutton, after various ministerial portfolios, including immigration and special minister of state, would have been testing, according to factional opponents.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget how hurt Alex would have been by being dumped by Dutton as well,‚Äù a¬†senior right source tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*. ‚ÄúThat would have been a huge motivating trigger for Alex.‚Äù

Over her 24 years in parliament, Sussan Ley has mostly identified as a moderate, although she eschewed the label. She has always been close to Hawke and the centre right.

Centre-right and moderate MPs combined to install Ley as leader in the post-election ballot over the hard right‚Äôs Taylor. Ley‚Äôs chief of staff is Dean Shachar, a player in NSW factional politics and a former staffer to Hawke, former Nationals leader Michael McCormack and Morrison.

‚ÄúHawke runs everything she does,‚Äù former Liberal leader John Hewson tells¬†*The Saturday Paper.*¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Hawke faction. It doesn‚Äôt sound as if it‚Äôs a right faction or left faction ‚Äì it‚Äôs all faction.

‚ÄúThis impacts over time, because the image of the party is still pretty much a shambles, driven by squabbles and leadership aspirations of Taylor and Tim Wilson and Andrew Hastie.‚Äù

Liberal insiders describe Hawke and Taylor as ‚Äúcompletely at war‚Äù factionally. Their disagreement is not on policy but on politics and power.

‚ÄúWhat area of public policy do Angus and Alex disagree on?‚Äù the senior right source says.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to make sense of the Liberal Party in NSW ‚Äì and the fact that Alex Hawke‚Äôs been in the middle of it for decades shows you where the problem might be. There are rights and centre rights and far rights and there‚Äôs allegiances between the left at different occasions, between different groups. A lot of it is personality driven, as opposed to public policy driven. It is a highly transactional environment.‚Äù

The moderate Liberal source sees it along more existential lines. ‚ÄúEssentially, there‚Äôs a broad coalition that‚Äôs come together to stop the forces of the extreme right taking control of the division,‚Äù they explain. ‚ÄúSo, a lot of people who are not common bedfellows have united to try and protect the party and ensure we remain relevant and electable.

‚ÄúPart of that is making sure that we‚Äôre open, inclusive and forward looking. And people like Jacinta Nampijinpa Price want to make us exclusive and not a place where all Australians can feel welcome.‚Äù

The fact Price made public Hawke‚Äôs effort to counsel her over her comments on the Indian diaspora was seen as a breach of protocol. Hawke was only doing what would be expected in his role.

‚ÄúIt is no surprise that a government enforcer would step up to the mark to try and address that. It would happen under any government. It would happen under any opposition,‚Äù former Morrison adviser Andrew Carswell tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*.

‚ÄúHe was right to call up and demand a response, demand an apology, and query what had gone on. It was very clear that Senator Price had overstepped the mark in a considerable way.

‚ÄúThe fact that this had been elevated publicly is not a poor reflection on him. It‚Äôs a¬†poor reflection on the senator.‚Äù

Price, who was dumped from shadow cabinet for failing to provide confidence in Ley‚Äôs leadership, is not backing down. Meanwhile, right-faction frontbencher Andrew Hastie is getting extra attention for being seen to undermine Ley through slick and pointed social media posts on the car industry and migration.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have much in the way of policy,‚Äù Price told radio station 2GB on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe are supposed to be an effective opposition. We do want to be able to do our job, so we‚Äôre not going to sit back and be silent until such time as we have policy positions on a number of issues.‚Äù

As for confidence in Ley: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to be able to have the confidence of the leader myself ‚Ä¶ I think the fact that I‚Äôve been demoted probably demonstrates that.‚Äù

Hawke is no stranger to controversy. As immigration minister, he moved the Nadesalingam family from immigration detention on Christmas Island to community detention in Perth but refused them a visa to return to Biloela in Queensland.

He is also the Morrison minister who cancelled the visa of the unvaccinated tennis champion Novak Djokovic. He left his explanation largely to media statements, saying the Serbian superstar‚Äôs presence at the 2022 Australian Open might lead to an increase in ‚Äúcivil unrest of the kind previously experienced in Australia with rallies and protests ‚Ä¶‚Äù

In these decisions and others, colleagues see Hawke as a fixer.

‚ÄúYou can almost compare him to a Murray Watt-type in that regard. Someone who‚Äôs going to go out and fix a problem,‚Äù Carswell says.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ruthless about it. They push everything aside and they‚Äôre just solely focused on getting this one job done. And that‚Äôs what he was asked to do as immigration minister. Very similar to \[Minister for the Environment and Water\] Murray Watt in that regard.‚Äù

Detractors say they don‚Äôt know what Hawke, now the manager of opposition business and opposition industry spokesman, stands for. They suggest he is ‚Äúenergised by the internal fight over the fight against Labor‚Äù.

‚ÄúAlex has to work hard to demonstrate to the wider community what is the reason that he‚Äôs in politics, yeah? What are those passions?‚Äù the senior right source says, before shifting their gaze to Ley.

‚ÄúIf Sussan needs Alex to secure her leadership, it demonstrates how weak her leadership is. Leaders do better when they‚Äôre not protecting their backs. They‚Äôre focused on making inroads into the communities their party needs to win over.

‚ÄúThere needs to be less focus on Machiavellian political games and manoeuvring and more focus on winning over the hearts and minds of middle Australia.‚Äù

Hawke tells¬†*The Saturday Paper*¬†he is committed to reforming and modernising the Liberal Party, which he says is in a better place under Ley.

‚ÄúShe deserves her chance to have her go. She‚Äôs been elected by the party room to lead. She‚Äôs leading. Any leader deserves their chance to set out their mandate, their position, and take the party the way they would like it to go,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúAnd I believe she‚Äôll be given that chance. I think, let her have that chance. Everyone gave Peter the chance he needed to¬†lead and to shine. And we ended up where we are.

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôll surprise people. I think she‚Äôs a tough and seasoned politician and I think some people underestimate her because she is a woman. But I say to them this: she‚Äôs the first female not just to lead the Liberal Party but to occupy the opposition leader position in Australian history.

‚ÄúAnd the Liberal Party ‚Äì men, women ‚Äì we all have an interest in her breaking that ground and going well, and we should get behind her.‚Äù

Anthony Albanese will join leading progressive world leaders, policy experts and strategists from almost 40 countries ‚Äì including Jacinda Ardern and some of US Democrats‚Äô top presidential contenders ‚Äì for a special summit in London that organisers say will demonstrate the power of progressive thinking and policies.

By Geoff Chambers

3 min. readView original

After arriving in London from New York on Friday (AEST), Mr Albanese is scheduled to hold a series of high-level meetings with progressive current and former world leaders including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and former Labour leader Tony Blair.

As Sir Keir faces rising leadership pressures ahead of the British Labour Party Conference in Liverpool ‚Äì where Mr Albanese on Sunday will be a keynote speaker following an audience with King Charles ‚Äì Mr Albanese and his British counterpart will meet several times during and following the Global Progress Action Summit.

Former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern.

After participating in a panel discussion alongside Sir Keir, Mr Carney and Iceland Prime Minister Kristrun Frostadottir, Mr Albanese will have a bilateral meeting with Mr Sanchez, who famously clashed with Donald Trump after refusing to meet US President‚Äôs demand that all NATO countries should increase defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP.

Jd Pritzker, the high-profile Democratic Illinois Governor, and Pete Buttigieg, a former US transport secretary under Joe Biden, are the most senior US progressive political figures attending the London summit. Both men are expected to run for president in 2028.

Former progressive leaders including Bill Clinton, Julia Gillard and Ms Ardern have previously spoken at previous summits. The former New Zealand prime minister, who pushed the concept of a ‚Äúwellbeing budget‚Äù, will again speak in London.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is heading to the UK for a meeting with his UK counterpart Keir Starmer. It's hoped the meeting will quash any concerns about the AUKUS defence pact, which the Trump administration is currently reviewing. During the trip, Australia‚Äôs Prime Minister will also meet Canada's Leader Mark Carney, who is in the UK for a summit. The trio of progressive leaders have become increasingly close, choosing to co-operate on the recognition of Palestine and climate change in contrast with the US.

Following a bilateral meeting with Mr Carney, Mr Albanese will head to 10 Downing Street for a bilateral meeting with Sir Keir, which is expected to focus on strengthening the UK-Australia relationship, locking-in certainty around the AUKUS nuclear submarine pact, responding to US tariffs and how the British Prime Minister has managed a strong relationship with Mr Trump. The Australian understands the meeting has not been designed around any major new announcement.

During his one-week visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Mr Albanese finally received confirmation from the White House that he would meet with Mr Trump in Washington DC on October 20.

As migration and economic pressures heap pain on Sir Keir and drive an unprecedented hole in his government‚Äôs polling numbers, many British Labour MPs and supporters will be tuned into Mr Albanese‚Äôs Labour Party conference speech to see what tips the Prime Minister can provide after he won 94 seats at the May 3 election. While the next British election is still years away, the dominance of Nigel Farage‚Äôs Reform UK party and rising competition with other left-leaning parties has fuelled concern about Sir Keir‚Äôs longer-term political success.

Previous Global Progress Action Summit conferences have been held in Montreal, Blackpool and Manchester. The summit is co-hosted by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the Institute for Public Policy Research and Labour Together.

AustralianPolitics,Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan and MPs Vicki Ward and Jaala Pulford knew about CFMEU threats on Big Build sites emails reveal,"Senior Victorian government members were privately briefed about violent CFMEU threats made on Labor‚Äôs Big Build projects, more than three years before federal authorities launched court action alleging the same conduct was illegal.

Leaked emails reveal Victorian government ministers, MPs and a senior staffer in Premier Jacinta Allan‚Äôs office were told about the CFMEU threats against an Indigenous firm in the lead up to the 2022 state election. They also show the government made private commitments to help the firm as it battled an allegedly unlawful union boycott on government sites.

But correspondence from the government stopped abruptly after the November election, and the company eventually collapsed as it tried to resolve the issues, first with the Australian Building and Construction Commission and then through the Fair Work Ombudsman.

The claims of the firm, Marda Dandhi, that it was targeted via a violent series of threats issued by CFMEU officials finally reached court this week when the federal ombudsman lodged a suit against the union for unlawful coercion.

One of the labour hire firm owners, who did not wish to be named out of concerns for his safety, accused the state government of stringing him on with empty promises that it would resolve the matter after the November 2022 election.

‚ÄúI think we were gaslit,‚Äù he told The Australian Financial Review. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want it out before the election because they would have had to answer to it.

‚ÄúFor me and other people you have to ask yourself why hasn‚Äôt there been a royal commission? What would come out and what would it reveal about what the government knew at the time? There‚Äôs no one accountable. I think politicians have got a lot to answer for.‚Äù

The labour hire owner joins former state anti-corruption commissioner Robert Redlich KC who earlier this month said the scale of alleged wrongdoing on the Big Build sites warranted a royal commission. Queensland is set to start hearings for its inquiry into the CFMEU and misconduct in construction on Wednesday.

The treatment of Marda Dandhi was first exposed in July 2024 by the Building Bad investigation by the Financial Review, The Age and 60 Minutes. It uncovered a video of a CFMEU organiser allegedly threatening to bash the two owners of Marda Dandhi, which was aligned with the rival Australian Workers‚Äô Union.

A union official was also recorded boasting the CFMEU controlled who could work on state government sites. Labor‚Äôs Big Build in Victoria is comprised of multiple massive projects in Melbourne funded by the state and federal governments, including the Suburban Rail Loop.

The leaked emails show the government was discussing the coercion case from April 2022 to up to four weeks before the November election. After the election, the communications ceased.

Labor MP Vicki Ward, who was parliamentary secretary of transport infrastructure at the time and is now minister of equality, held a one-hour meeting with a Marda Dandhi owner ‚Äì who was a constituent in her seat of Eltham in Melbourne‚Äôs northern suburbs ‚Äì about the allegations early in 2022.

She advised him to go to police after he told her that ‚Äúunsavoury characters‚Äù were surveilling his family home when he was threatening to speak up on CFMEU coercion.

She said she had briefed Allan‚Äôs deputy chief of staff of in April and advised that then-small business minister Jaala Pulford was handling the ‚Äúserious‚Äù allegations, according to the emails. Allan was responsible for the Big Build at the time as Victoria‚Äôs infrastructure minister. She became premier in September 2023 after Daniel Andrews retired following Labor‚Äôs election win.

Allan has repeatedly said claims of CFMEU coercion and kicking off subcontractors from state government sites were the responsibility of the state‚Äôs principal contractors or the Commonwealth.

The Financial Review has previously reported that Marda Dandhi wrote to Allan in April 2022 detailing the violence and abuse the owners had been subjected to. But the emails are the first insight into what was going on behind the scenes.

When Allan finally responded to Marda Dandhi in April 2023, she referred it to the federal government or state infrastructure authorities. The firm collapsed a few months later.

An Allan government spokesman said on Thursday: ‚ÄúAs this matter is before the courts it is not appropriate to comment on specific cases.



‚ÄúWe are making sure that people coming forward with information about conduct on worksites have the complaints processes and protections they deserve ‚Äì while also ensuring any complaint made is assessed and referred to the appropriate regulator.‚Äù

‚ÄòA little unsettling‚Äô

Pulford, who did not contest the 2022 election and has retired from politics, could not be reached for comment.

In an email sent to Marda Dandhi on April 19, 2022, Ward said she had met with Allan‚Äôs deputy chief of staff that morning ‚Äúas we work through this situation and see what can be done to help‚Äù.

Ward was responding to the owner‚Äôs emails detailing the CFMEU intimidation and that his neighbour had informed him that ‚Äútwo unsavoury characters had been parked on the corner of his property and had been watching my property‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhen he made himself aware to them the cars have driven off,‚Äù the owner wrote to Ward. ‚ÄúFor him to think that sighting warrants informing me is a little unsettling.‚Äù

When the owner emailed again in October suggesting he had lost patience and mentioning the coming election, Ward sought to assure him the government was still on the case.

In her last communication to the owner on October 31, 2022, Ward said she had been having ‚Äúmany conversations in the background‚Äù.

‚ÄúI met with Minister Pulford a few months ago (and have been in communication with her since), and she has let me know she‚Äôs taking the matters seriously and steps are being taken to work through the challenges you‚Äôre facing,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI know it isn‚Äôt the full resolution you are expecting and I hear how stressful and challenging this is for your business, however we are trying to find a resolution.‚Äù

The Indigenous firm owner told the Financial Review that when he went to the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2022 the building watchdog told him it could not help him as the Albanese government had cut its funding.

He went to the Fair Work Ombudsman in May 2023. Two and half years later, the FWO launched its legal action against the CFMEU, alleging organisers Joel Shackleton and Gerry McCrudden threatened and abused the Marda Dandhi owners.

The government has been continually pushing the price of tobacco further and further upwards, in the meantime we've created a huge market opportunity for organised crime, who have stepped in and carved out a nice $10B market for them, in which the government is collecting 0% tax on, because they got too greedy and the market provided a solution at an acceptable price to smokers.

I spent the last four weeks working with a crew from Malaysia and Indonesia in Melbourne, who are in town on work visas, they're all heavy smokers, they've been in the country for a few weeks, less than a month, and they're all smoking the illegal Manchesters, they've found a source right near where we're working.

Where I usually work, all smoking Manchesters, no one is buying legitimate tobacco for $50-$60 when you can get Manchesters for $10-$13 at the local cafe around the corner from the workshop.

All these so called 'educated' people at universities pushing for these ridiculous taxes on tobacco, need to go outside and touch grass, maybe talk to people from various communities for once.

Health minister concedes tobacco black market has 'exploded'

&gt;In short:

&gt;Health Minister Mark Butler has conceded organised crime now has a ""stranglehold"" on illicit tobacco.

&gt;NSW Premier Chris Minns has urged for taxes on tobacco to be revisited, saying high prices have pushed people to the black market.

&gt;What's next?

&gt;Mr Butler has flagged that state enforcement measures must be improved.

Massola
September 25, 2025

When Coalition MPs were jostling for fresh positions after their shattering election loss this year, Andrew Hastie had one request of new leader Sussan Ley. The West Australian MP and former soldier wanted to branch out of the security space.

Hastie had felt pigeonholed during his three years as defence spokesman under Peter Dutton. Colleagues say the WA frontbencher, one of the few opposition MPs to improve the Liberal vote in his electorate, grew increasingly frustrated as Dutton, himself a former defence minister, kept Hastie out of the political fray, partly so he didn‚Äôt emerge as a rival. Hastie used his spare time in the previous parliament to study for a graduate diploma in economics online through Harvard Extension School and expand his credentials.

So when it came time for Ley to reset the frontbench in May, Hastie asked to spread his wings. He requested either an economics portfolio or something firmly outside national security, such as health or education. Ley gave him home affairs.

Several close colleagues say this grievance is one driver of Hastie‚Äôs bullish activity in the past few months. The frontbencher, 42, is building a brand as a conviction politician by commenting on issues outside his portfolio in a steady stream of provocative social media posts and radio interviews.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been terribly frustrated at a personal and professional level,‚Äù says a friend and political ally. Now, he‚Äôs refusing to be boxed in.

Observes one Liberal colleague: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he has just decided to say what he thinks from now on, to speak his mind.‚Äù

As Hastie outlines a new direction for the Liberals, he‚Äôs activating a cheer squad among elements of the party‚Äôs right, who are pushing his leadership potential. Other colleagues are suspicious of his strategy. Hastie is not cowed by their criticism; he‚Äôs called Liberal MPs who background against him ‚Äúnameless cowards‚Äù and ‚Äúmuppets‚Äù. His actions have fuelled speculation of a leadership challenge, and Hastie is doing little to douse that.

But those close to him say his mission is much broader. His endgame is a re-booted Liberal Party that stands for family, community and nation, rather than worshipping at the altar of globalisation. If that means splintering the party or losing his seat, so be it.

Opposition home affairs spokesman Andrew Hastie.
Hastie has thrown down the gauntlet on energy policy, threatening to quit his position if the Coalition did not abandon the net zero by 2050 emissions target ‚Äì and launched his own ‚ÄúAustralia First‚Äù campaign to bring back local manufacturing.

The themes of sovereignty, national identity and Western decay ‚Äì which have dominated Hastie‚Äôs reading over many years ‚Äì are central to his vision for the party.

This masthead requested an interview with Hastie, but he declined, saving his policy positions for brief radio interviews or for his Instagram account.

Slick new social media posts lament a lost Australia, decry the ‚Äúradical left‚Äù as ‚Äúevil‚Äù, and call for a return to family values. Much of this language echoes that of contemporary right-wing speakers and influencers in the UK and the US, while his protectionist slant mirrors Donald Trump and European populist movements.

When Hastie made his run for the outer Perth seat of Canning in a 2015 byelection ‚Äì shortly after key backer Tony Abbott was ousted as prime minister ‚Äì posters pictured him in military uniform and cradling a baby with his wife, promising he ‚Äúwas not another politician‚Äù.

He was soon dumped by the Army Reserve because he refused to remove photos of himself in uniform from campaign material. Hastie‚Äôs 14 years of military service included time as a Special Air Service commander in Afghanistan, where he served at the same time as disgraced soldier Ben Roberts-Smith. Hastie testified against Roberts-Smith in a drawn-out defamation trial, and hailed the ‚Äúmoral courage‚Äù of other SAS soldiers who entered the witness box. His successive appointments to security portfolios started with his role as assistant defence minister in the Morrison government, in 2020.

But Hastie also described himself in his first speech as a keen student of history. Before joining the ADF, he started a bachelor of arts degree in history, politics and philosophy. While he resisted his family‚Äôs religion as a teenager ‚Äì his father was a Presbyterian pastor ‚Äì Hastie has a deeply held Christian faith. He was in the headlines as a candidate for refusing to be drawn on his father‚Äôs views on creationism.

Colleagues say he continues to wrestle with how, as party leader, he would explain his positions on same-sex marriage, abortion and women in military combat roles to an increasingly secular Australia.

As he freelances outside his home affairs portfolio, Hastie is homing in on energy, domestic manufacturing and Western values. Ten days ago, he drew attention with a declaration that he would quit the frontbench or be sacked if the Coalition retained a target of net zero emissions by 2050.

‚ÄúMy primary mission in politics is to build a stronger, more secure, more competitive Australia. Energy security is a vital input into that, so that‚Äôs my bottom line,‚Äù he told ABC radio. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve nailed my colours to the mast.‚Äù

At the end of the week, he pitched his vision for that Australia in a social media video filmed next to a red 1969 Ford Falcon. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a nation of flat-white makers, when we could be making beautiful cars like this again,‚Äù he lamented. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about the cars. It‚Äôs this sense that we‚Äôve lost something, that we‚Äôre now just helpless consumers. The Australian people are at our best when we unlock our innate God-given drive to design and build complex things.‚Äù

When colleagues questioned what he was doing, in anonymous quotes to newspapers, Hastie bit back. ‚ÄúNameless cowards briefing in the paper,‚Äù he posted to Instagram.

But politics, for Hastie, is not just about economics. ‚ÄúPolitics is now firmly a contest of ideas for our way of life, and we need to fight for our Western ideas and values,‚Äù he told his mailing list in a message sent after US conservative activist Charlie Kirk‚Äôs assassination two weeks ago. He asked subscribers to examine Raphael‚Äôs Paul Preaching at Athens, painted for the Sistine Chapel in the early 1500s, to see the best of Western civilisation on display: faith, reason, inquiry, debate and persuasion.

Young people around the world were being severed from this Christian tradition, he wrote, and universities were repudiating Western values. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we see the pronouns, the grievance, the tantrums, and the violence ... The radical left are evil and will use violence to win. Let‚Äôs stop pretending they act in good faith.‚Äù

The answer, he said, was to be bold, courageous and grow a movement. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt get moving, the West will continue to decline,‚Äù he wrote.

That extends to the Liberal Party. ‚ÄúThe Liberal Party will be in exile for a long time until we act in the interests of the Australian people,‚Äù Hastie wrote in a separate social media post about immigration on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt act, we can expect anger and frustration. We might even die as a political movement. So be it. What is the point of politics, if you‚Äôre not willing to fight for something?‚Äù

As the Liberal Party searches for its purpose after the May 3 federal election, leader Sussan Ley is trying to bring it back to the political centre. Hastie has different ideas. He wants to reframe the climate change conversation as one about energy security. He believes the Australian economy was opened far too wide in the 1980s, and it is time for a correction.

‚ÄúA lot of people would like us to stay exactly where we are, including some people on our party side, but we can‚Äôt,‚Äù Hastie said on radio station 2GB on Thursday.

‚ÄúThe world has changed since the Howard and Costello years. We‚Äôve had the global financial crisis, we‚Äôve had Brexit, we‚Äôve had the rise of Xi Jinping and China. We‚Äôve had Trump. Had the pandemic. The world has changed, and we have to change with it.‚Äù

Bringing back manufacturing for Australians who lost out when the car industry left the country is a key part of Hastie‚Äôs pitch. But it‚Äôs anathema to the free market consensus that has dominated Liberal thinking for five decades. One of the Liberals‚Äô leading moderates, NSW senator Maria Kovacic, said Hastie was a respected and hardworking colleague, but she disagreed with him on the issue.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a liberal, not a protectionist,‚Äù she said, in response to a Hastie post. ‚ÄúWe need to focus on delivering outcomes for the realities of modern Australia ... Our existence isn‚Äôt threatened by not looking backwards; our existence is threatened by not looking forwards.‚Äù

Peter Dutton kept Hastie in the background during the election campaign.

Nor are Hastie‚Äôs ideas neatly at home with the conservative, or right wing, element of the party. Some of the group‚Äôs leading members, such as finance spokesman James Paterson, are traditional champions of free market liberal economics, not government intervention.

But that right-wing faction, the largest in the parliamentary party, is itself divided over social and economic policies. It lacks the coherence of previous terms, after leaders Peter Dutton and Michael Sukkar were booted from parliament in the election. In that vacuum, conservative MPs are experimenting with new ideas.

Hastie saw Dutton as a continuity candidate who was more conservative in tone than substance. He has no intention of imitating the former leader. ‚ÄúHe wants to do it his own way,‚Äù one ally said.

Several colleagues are cheering him on. Publicly, they have included outspoken senators Matt Canavan and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, as well as younger Queensland right-wingers Henry Pike and Garth Hamilton. The latter represent a new brand of Coalition MPs who champion conservative cultural issues but not the free market thinking that has been dear to Liberals for decades.

On Thursday former Liberal minister Arthur Sinodinos urged the party to unite behind a centrist message. ‚ÄúIf you want to have an effective opposition you have to be united, you have to speak with one voice,‚Äù he said on ABC radio. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been too much focus on the culture wars and not enough on the bread and butter issues that impact Australians.‚Äù

Jacinta Nampijinpa Price says she wants to unite Australia under one flag.
But Price leapt to Hastie‚Äôs defence this week. ‚ÄúAt a time when Australians are looking for substance and vision from their leaders, Andrew is demonstrating both vision and substance,‚Äù Price wrote on social media. The next day, in an interview with 2GB, she pointed out an alignment in their values. Price said the key institutions of Australian life ‚Äì family, community and nation ‚Äì were ‚Äúat the core of [what] Andrew Hastie‚Äôs leading with‚Äù.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôd make a remarkable leader one day,‚Äù she said.

Hastie has not been shy about his leadership ambitions. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be foolish to say I don‚Äôt have a desire to lead. I do have a desire to lead,‚Äù he said on the Curtin‚Äôs Cast podcast, released on May 14. He said he didn‚Äôt run in the post-election leadership ballot for personal reasons ‚Äì his children are aged three, seven and nine ‚Äì but said leadership was not confined to a single role. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also got to lead in the battle of ideas as well, and I think that‚Äôs where I want to make a contribution,‚Äù he said.

Ley won the ballot against Angus Taylor, now defence spokesman, by a slim margin of 29-25. Neither Taylor nor Hastie is counting numbers, but both know Ley‚Äôs leadership is precarious.

Taylor tells his colleagues that Ley needs to clearly demonstrate she has failed before any challenge is put, meaning any move would likely come next year. Hastie insists he‚Äôs a team player. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just being a little bolder in some of the policy positions that I think we should adopt,‚Äù he said in the 2GB interview on Thursday, when asked how his interventions were being received by the leader‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm simply stating some positions, mainly through social media, and people can interpret that how they want. But I just think we need to reconstitute our natural consistency on the centre right, if we‚Äôre going to be a force to beat Labor in two years.‚Äù

Some on the right see Hastie‚Äôs posturing as more of an attempt to overtake Taylor than to immediately topple Ley. Taylor carries baggage, having lost the party ballot and failed to deliver an economic message as shadow treasurer. The defence spokesman‚Äôs colleagues say he remains intent on becoming leader, but at least three of his previous key lieutenants now want Hastie to be the next challenger instead.

But those close to Hastie say the leadership is not the only thing that motivates him. ‚ÄúIf he was this thrusting, egocentric person that people make him out to be, he would have run for leader,‚Äù says the friend and ally mentioned earlier. ‚ÄúThis is about leadership, to some extent, but it‚Äôs a little deeper than that. He wants a debate on direction and values, which has been absent for years.‚Äù

One Liberal MP says it is clear Hastie has leadership ambitions, ‚Äúbut I think his mission is ideological, that he is trying to reshape the centre of gravity in the Liberal Party, so it is more conservative, or MAGA-like‚Äù.

It might not work. One sceptical MP from the right said: ‚ÄúThis MAGA turn won‚Äôt help Andrew win votes in the party, particularly not people like Jane Hume and sensible types you need to win a ballot‚Äù.

Hastie‚Äôs recent pronouncements would create buzz on the party‚Äôs fringes, the MP said, but fail to create support among centrists and more pragmatic right-wingers such as James Paterson, Claire Chandler and Jonno Duniam.

Andrew Hastie insists he is a team player.

Another moderate MP said Hastie‚Äôs positions were so divorced from Liberal orthodoxy that they would eventually be held against him. The MP would not fight Hastie in public because, like his ally Price, he was ‚Äúflaming out‚Äù on his own.

Hastie might not mind. ‚ÄúIf I go out with the tide in 2¬Ω years, that‚Äôs great; I‚Äôll get a lot more time with my kids back,‚Äù he said last week.

But in the meantime, he‚Äôs preparing for battle. In response to a comment left on one of his social media posts about Charlie Kirk, which asked about the right-wing speaker‚Äôs contentious views on race and sexuality, Hastie spoke in life-and-death terms about what he sees as a hinge point in history.

AustralianPolitics,"Truth is, Labor should fear a leader like Andrew Hastie","Over recent months, something rare and dangerous for Labor and the left has begun to emerge: a Liberal politician who doesn‚Äôt follow neoliberal orthodoxies and speaks credibly to working-class material interests. Andrew Hastie is making serious claims on what many of us thought was Labor business.

If Labor does not take notice now, it risks losing votes later.

For decades I have argued that Labor‚Äôs old base among the fibro-and-mortgage belts, the outer suburbs, and regional Australia is not just drifting; it is in ferment. The working class is no longer monolithic. It is multiethnic, often small-c conservative on culture and national security, more open to left-wing economics, and anxious at being left behind on housing and social mobility. Hastie sees his opening, and Labor must defend the ground with more than mockery on TikTok.

Hastie has been steadily sharpening a message that repudiates key doctrines of free-market economics. On the John Curtin Research Centre‚Äôs podcast in May, Hastie spoke of the importance of industrial capacity, national resilience and strategic economic sovereignty.



Broadcaster Lucy Zelic says Shadow Minister for Home Affairs Andrew Hastie has a ‚Äúvision‚Äù for Australia. ‚ÄúThank God we finally have a politician within the Coalition, or more specifically the Liberal Party, that is actually prepared to put out a vision for this country,‚Äù Ms Zelic told Sky News host Paul Murray. ‚ÄúWho is happy to celebrate things like manufacturing, advocating for Australia to return to greatness in that aspect. ‚ÄúThere is nothing controversial about what Andrew Hastie is saying, I do agree with the commentary that he is a future leader of this country.‚Äù

He made clear that while he wasn‚Äôt running for leader, he intended to lead in the battle of ideas.

On Sunday, in a much-discussed social media video filmed beside a red 1969 Ford Falcon, Hastie went further by extolling local manufacturing and urging Australia to make ‚Äúcomplex things‚Äù again. In response to criticism from colleagues and some economists, he blasted the ‚Äúnameless cowards‚Äù still clutching their ‚Äúdog-eared copies of Hayek‚Äù. It was a striking admission: many of his Liberal colleagues remain locked in the old market fundamentalism frame, but Hastie intends to break it and isn‚Äôt afraid to put noses out of joint in the process.

This was no throwaway line. It was a genuine conservative staking a claim to the voters who delivered Labor its federal resurgence across 2022-25: working-class Australians who build, drive and make. They want security, decent jobs, and a government prepared to make things here, not airy lectures about global markets or technocratic climate targets.

Hastie is on to something. From focus groups and polling conducted for the John Curtin Research Centre pre and post-election, we know many working-class Australians are restless with the political establishment, no matter the size of Labor‚Äôs victory. They feel that the left has too often drifted from its core business of material politics, but the LNP has little to offer them beyond post-material culture wars and a reflexive faith in free-market panaceas.

Enter Hastie. He speaks of energy abundance, industrial capacity and national ambition. Not just national security, but economic security: making things here, protecting jobs, producing rather than just consuming, or being a nation of baristas. For working people worried about cost of living, insecure work, affordable housing, the promise of real, physical industry ‚Äì factories and supply chains ‚Äì this is music to their ears, coupled with Hastie‚Äôs insistence: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been ideologically constrained; we must break from those constraints.‚Äù

Hastie‚Äôs call to rebuild industrial capacity echoes an older conservative insight: a nation‚Äôs strength lies in its people and the durability of its institutions. Edmund Burke would likely approve. True conservatism means prudent stewardship and the preservation of social bonds ‚Äì an allegiance to what endures and works, not to laissez-faire dogma or market fetishism.

Labor risks two complementary errors. First, mistaking its current electoral map for a permanent realignment, as though recent wins in progressive urban seats insulate it from challenge when many outer-suburban and regional voters remain in play and potentially attracted to a Hastie-like leader. Second, assuming that technocratic incrementalism is enough to hold those voters, when the deeper desire is for secure, meaningful work and a productive economy. Working people want more than redistribution. They want production, dignity in work, making useful stuff, being part of supply, having industry in their region, and economic resilience, not just service jobs.

Andrew Hastie

Hastie is also cultivating an outsider brand ‚Äì a stance tailor-made for the unsettled politics of 2025 and the mess that is the Liberal Party‚Äôs current identity. Australian history shows how potent this formula can be: leaders who position themselves as insurgents against their own party‚Äôs orthodoxies often end up revitalising it.

Gough Whitlam broke Labor‚Äôs factional shackles to modernise the party and win government in 1972; Bob Hawke leveraged his larrikin persona to recast Labor as a reformist powerhouse; Kevin Rudd rode a ‚ÄúLabor but not of Labor‚Äù persona to victory in 2007; even Mark Latham, before his later implosion, briefly electrified politics with a similar anti-establishment energy. Hastie‚Äôs appeal to industrial strength and strategic sovereignty, delivered with a whiff of rebel defiance, draws from that same outsider tradition and could yet haul the Liberals out of their own wilderness.

But the Latham experiment also offers a warning: permanent opposition to your own party is a lonely and unsustainable position, and veering too far right ‚Äì into Jacinta Nampijinpa Price territory on migration ‚Äì which risks alienating the centre; a true Burkean knows that prudence, especially on issues like the environment, is the essence of conservatism.

For Labor, this is a red alert in more ways than one. Just as Britain‚Äôs Red Tory movement married social conservatism with Brexitism and delivered to Boris Johnson at the 2019 election the highest percentage vote for any party since 1979, and Donald Trump‚Äôs takeover of the GOP transformed a free-market party into a populist movement built on economic nationalism, trade protection and a blue-collar appeal, Hastie offers a mirror image of the Blue Labour ideology that has quietly underpinned Labor‚Äôs recent success: pro-worker, communitarian, sceptical of neoliberal orthodoxies. He shows that a Liberal can break with trickle-down economics while speaking to patriotism and national pride.

Team Albanese can‚Äôt afford complacency. Voters are volatile the world over and will punish drift. If Labor fails to match delivery with ambition, Hastie‚Äôs brand of patriotic economic nationalism could become the rallying point that drags the Liberals back to power.",0.42,0,0,0,en-AU

Victoria's Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton in July 2020.

No country loves formal inquiries as much as Australia. In the past 20 years federal and state governments have launched dozens of royal commissions, more than Britain, New Zealand and Canada combined.

If pink batts, casino licences and Robodebt justified their great cost and sweeping powers, surely the nation‚Äôs Covid response, which squandered hundreds of billions of dollars, wrecked the lives and livelihoods of thousands, and trashed supposedly fundamental human rights, warrants one, too.

Former Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton‚Äôs courageous observation this week that many of the draconian Covid measures were ‚Äúprobably not necessary‚Äù should trigger fresh calls for a proper inquiry, as Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay did earlier this year.

It‚Äôs far from too late; New Zealand, Britain, Italy and the Netherlands are still in the midst of theirs.

The Labor government‚Äôs self-congratulatory Covid ‚Äúinquiry‚Äù, published last year, authored by individuals who by and large backed the novel response, was a whitewash, written by public servants and academics, not independent retired judges, who naturally disinclined to upset their political masters.

‚ÄúPeople should be proud of what we achieved during the pandemic ‚Ä¶ Australia had lesser health and economic impacts in the pandemic than most other countries around the world ‚Ä¶ because we had people who worked unbelievably hard and made difficult decisions ‚Äì all in the country‚Äôs best interests,‚Äù the inquiry concluded.



Former Victorian Liberal Party president Michael Kroger discusses former Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton admitting the state's health measures were probably never necessary. ‚ÄúIt was so extreme here and it was not based on medical advice,‚Äù Mr Kroger told Sky News Presenter Gabriella Power. ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äôs still suffering years later.‚Äù

Aside from the childish boasting, the core empirical claim there is not substantiated. In fact, the maniacal focus on preventing Covid cases and deaths, with or from, to the detriment of everything else, lumbered the nation with massive and enduring socio-economic costs that should be estimated.

‚ÄúMaybe we will agree as a society that we never want to do that (lockdown) again. I‚Äôm OK with that,‚Äù Sutton told Neil Mitchell in an hour-long interview reviewing the sense of Victoria‚Äôs 262-day, world-beating lockdown. ‚ÄúThere are other ways to manage stuff.‚Äù

Indeed, the rational and numerate among us, who were publicly excoriated, were OK with that in 2020. After all, the nation‚Äôs 2019 pandemic plan, still sitting awkwardly on the Health Department website at the time of writing, specifically recommended against workplace and school closures.

‚ÄúCompliance with most measures by the individual will be implemented on a voluntary basis,‚Äù it stressed numerous times.

The thoughtful 232-page document, which doesn‚Äôt canvass elbow bumping or ‚Äúrings of steel‚Äù, also stressed the importance of proportionality, and defined ‚Äúlow-severity‚Äù pandemics as those where ‚Äúthe majority of cases are likely to experience mild to moderate clinical features ‚Ä¶ (while) people in at-risk groups may experience more severe illness‚Äù. That sounds like Covid-19.

Professor Brett Sutton speaks to the media in April 2020.

Professor Brett Sutton speaks to the media in April 2020.

A proper Covid inquiry must investigate why our response deviated so drastically from the pandemic plan, along with dispelling persistent misinformation around Covid death rates. Sutton, for all his commendable reflection, still believes the Covid-19 death rate was 1.5-2 per cent. Yet the average global infection fatality rate was 0.15 per cent by February 2021, even before the less deadly Omicron variant emerged, according to internationally renowned epidemiologist John Ionnadis in a May 2021 peer-reviewed article.

Even Donald Trump, who in early March 2020 controversially predicted on Fox News the IFR would be ‚Äúway under 1 per cent‚Äù, was better informed than our health experts.

Institute of Public Affairs Chief Economist Adam Creighton has slammed former Victorian premier Daniel Andrews' ‚Äúshameful‚Äù lockdowns. An email, obtained by Sky News Australia, showed that Victorian COVID curfews were proposed without any formal input from health experts. ‚ÄúThis just really worsens the wound,‚Äù Mr Creighton told Sky News Digital Presenter Gabriella Power. ‚ÄúThe devastation as a result is just extraordinary.‚Äù

Why did the measures in Australia last so excruciatingly long? When Dan Andrews‚Äô police were firing rubber bullets at Australians and tackling people to the ground for being outside maskless in September 2021, I was sitting in a crowded cafe in Miami watching the horror unfold. The rest of the world had moved on, why hadn‚Äôt we?, and how can we change institutions to more easily puncture local hysteria next time

According to a newly published study in the latest Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, the young, healthy women typically used by the Australian and other governments in advertising campaign ‚Äì to scare people into compliance ‚Äì faced a greater risk of dying from a once-every-17,000-year ‚Äúcivilisation-ending‚Äù volcanic eruption. Should such blatant propaganda, however effective, be permissible in the next pandemic?

Finally, was de facto compulsory vaccination of the entire population against Covid wise? In May the federal Health Department quietly removed its recommendation for Covid-19 vaccination in healthy children and adolescents under 18, after earlier insisting on it and casting anyone who disagreed as anti-science. Almost no one is getting the vaccine now despite ongoing recommendations to do so.

Australia wasn‚Äôt the only nation to egregiously overreact to Covid, but we remain bizarrely smug about it, despite the mounting body of international evidence that suggests severe measures did very little to ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù, and caused immense and ongoing socio-economic and even health harms.

The Australian‚Äôs Washington Correspondent Adam Creighton says the UK, Australia and US all abandoned their pandemic plans after seeing that China's lockdown seemed ""to work"". ‚ÄúThe UK, Australia and US, all the Western countries had pandemic plans,"" he told Sky News host Rita Panahi. ‚ÄúIn all these plans they never said to lock your society down for months on end, let alone multiple times like in the case of Victoria. ‚ÄúThat was really something we saw China do, and the rest of the world thought ‚Ä¶ it seems to work.""

A proper inquiry shouldn‚Äôt be about pointscoring ‚Äì I wrote to Sutton this week praising him for his candour. It‚Äôs not easy to admit error.

Australia set dangerous precedents during the pandemic, which unless explicitly jettisoned will dog our prosperity and reputation. Indeed, new WHO health regulations came into effect last week that will require Australia to crack down on ‚Äúmisinformation and disinformation‚Äù, and toughen digital surveillance of citizens. The US, Italy and Israel among others had the good sense to reject them as an affront to sovereignty and civil liberties.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people would wear it (lockdowns) again,‚Äù veteran broadcaster Mitchell mused during the interview.

But if Australia‚Äôs unique cocktail of coercive madness isn‚Äôt formally disavowed, via a formal, dispassionate inquiry, the working assumption is surely that it will all happen again.

The chance of a Covid-like pandemic in the next couple of decades is about 50 per cent, according to the University of California Davis‚Äôs Centre for Global Development. This is far from an academic issue.

AustralianPolitics,"‚ÄòStrangers in our own home‚Äô: Hastie posts again, blaming migration for housing crisis","# Outspoken federal opposition frontbencher Andrew Hastie claims Australians feel like ‚Äústrangers in our own home‚Äù, saying the post-pandemic influx of migrants was creating a housing crisis that could keep the Liberals in exile for years if the party did not tackle it.

# [Paul Sakkal](https://www.smh.com.au/by/paul-sakkal-h17jxj)¬†and¬†[**James Massola**](https://www.smh.com.au/by/james-massola-hvf20)

Most housing experts contend high house prices have been driven mostly by a failure to build enough homes, but Hastie put a spotlight on migrant-driven demand in an Instagram post on Wednesday, making it the latest policy issue on which he has put forward populist talking points that differ from those of Opposition Leader Sussan Ley.

Ley‚Äôs leadership is not under immediate threat of being challenged, according to several party MPs. However, a group of right-wing Liberals are privately building up Hastie as the conservative alternative to Ley while he lays out a social media-driven crusade on nativist policies on local manufacturing, family values, migration and energy.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting to feel like strangers in our own home,‚Äù Hastie wrote in the post.

‚ÄúOur infrastructure is under pressure, essential services from schools and hospitals are stretched thin. Australians are locked out of the housing market. Many are house poor, spending most of their income on rent or mortgages.‚Äù

‚ÄúLabor talk about a housing supply crisis, but this is a housing demand crisis. Driven by unsustainable immigration. It‚Äôs that simple.‚Äù

Hastie added that the net overseas migration number, which grew rapidly after years of weak population growth during the pandemic, must be cut. Both Labor and the Coalition pledged steep decreases to the net overseas figure at the last election. Last week, the¬†[Australian Bureau of Statistics published figures](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5mw53)¬†showing that over the past 12 months, net overseas migration was 315,900, a drop of 19,000 on the annual result to the end of December.

It is down by 177,899 on the March quarter of 2024. Net overseas migration peaked at 555,798 in the September quarter of 2023, around the time migration experts and the Coalition accused Labor of losing control of the post-COVID surge.

Hastie‚Äôs remarks echoed those of Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price this month when she argued that ‚Äúmass migration‚Äù was creating an infrastructure and housing crunch. Hastie did not use the term ‚Äúmass migration‚Äù or single out any migrant group, as Price did, leading to¬†[her demotion¬†](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5mtt2)from shadow cabinet.

The phrase ‚Äústrangers in their own country‚Äù was popularised by a controversial speech from British conservative MP Enoch Powell in 1968. British Labour PM Keir Starmer, under¬†[political pressure over illegal migration](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5mszb), said in June that he regretted delivering a speech in which he said Britain risked becoming an ‚Äúan island of strangers‚Äù.

Price, speaking on 2GB on Wednesday, said some of Hastie‚Äôs colleagues viewed him as ‚Äúsome kind of threat‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have much in the way of policy. We are supposed to be an effective opposition. We do want to be able to do our job, so we‚Äôre not going to sit back and be silent until such time as we have our policy positions on a number of issues.‚Äù

Polls show Australians believe migration remains too high, but most housing experts, on the left and right, conclude that the housing shortage is driven far more by a lack of construction than high migration.

Hastie is the spokesman for home affairs and therefore has policy responsibility for immigration, giving Ley no grounds to pull him up for veering outside his portfolio. However, his dramatic rhetoric will be viewed as provocative by party insiders amid speculation over his ambitions to lead the Liberals.

He told this masthead the post represented his personal views and largely echoed a speech he delivered in parliament earlier this year.

Ley has been attempting to improve relations with the Indian and Chinese diasporas since the election and has said that migrants are not personally to blame for infrastructure and housing crunches.

‚ÄúIt is not a failing of migrants or any individual migrant community. It is a failure of this government by not getting the balance right between the provision of that important infrastructure and the levels of migration,‚Äù she said on September 8.

AustralianPolitics,"SA Premier Peter Malinauskas has blasted ‚Äòeco-purists‚Äô at an energy conference hosted by The Australian this week, and he was absolutely right","If I told you someone stood up at an energy conference hosted by The Australian this week and blasted the ‚Äúeco-purists‚Äù on social media for standing in the way of gas as a power source, you‚Äôd probably have a guess as someone like Barnaby Joyce.

But you‚Äôd be wrong because it was SA Premier Peter Malinauskas ‚Äì and he was promptly backed in by NSW Premier Chris Minns.

Two Labor leaders saying what the prime minister won‚Äôt and what all Liberals ought to.

And not just in polite terms.

Mr Malinauskas was blistering.

‚ÄúThe eco-purists that fill Instagram with screeds demanding an end to gas production should be careful what they wish for,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnd for the rest of us: are we going to let our energy policy be determined by the socials, or the science?‚Äù

He went after ‚ÄúLock the Gate NIMBYS and Greens‚Äù, said that ‚Äúwithout gas there is no firming of our electricity system‚Ä¶ and without firming, there are no renewables‚Äù and to oppose gas in favour of the fanciful idea of total renewables ‚Äútruly ¬≠beggars belief‚Äù.

Bang ‚Äì he did not miss.

Mr Minns said Mr Malinauskas was ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù right.

It is alarming that this clarity should come from Labor state premiers rather than the Labor federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, whose language on gas is far softer and who has previously said that ‚Äúfossil fuels have no ongoing role to play in our energy system‚Äù.

This is why Mr Malinauskas will be essentially unassailable as premier ‚Äì because he governs from the sensible Labor right and says things that ought to be coming out of the mouths of Liberals.

His comments were made in support of the Narrabri gas project in NSW ‚Äì driven by Santos ‚Äì which has been bogged down by years of regulatory delay and activist opposition.

He has skewered the juvenile idealism of green activists who would rather plunge the country into darkness or force us to pay exorbitant power bills than compromise and accept that renewables also need fossil fuels to make them viable.

It‚Äôs the same garbage that underpins the country‚Äôs new 2035 reduction target of 62-70 per cent.

That number, according to the Climate Change Authority which drafted it, is predicated on half of all vehicles sold between last Thursday and 2035 being electric.

It is as likely to happen as me being the next leader of the Greens, but that‚Äôs the fantasy world these people are living in.

At the same energy forum, on Wednesday, Queensland Treasurer David Janetzki said coal would be part of that state‚Äôs energy mix into at least the 2040s, despite the federal government‚Äôs aim being to expunge it all by 2035.

Again, it‚Äôs a state leader saying the quiet part out loud ‚Äì that which Chris Bowen and Anthony Albanese don‚Äôt want to admit ‚Äì which is that their green fantasy land where wind and solar provide the cheapest energy you‚Äôve ever seen does not exist.

Renewable energy can, of course, be part of the energy mix, as should all other forms, including nuclear.

**Opposition Leader Sussan Ley must be knackered. Having just navigated the drama caused by Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price‚Äôs race-baiting, now she has to deal with Canning MP Andrew Hastie.**

We‚Äôre not making any assumptions about Hastie‚Äôs personal aspirations, but the past 16 years or so have given Crikey a very clear idea of the distinct stages of a leadership coup.


Let‚Äôs see how his recent activity lines up.

Step 1: Early whispers

The first major challenge is getting yourself described as future leadership material.

This phase can last years. As detailed in David Marr‚Äôs Quarterly Essay ‚ÄúPower Trip‚Äù, in the early to mid-2000s, Kevin Rudd built his reputation as a loveable wonk on Sunrise and a man of some intellectual heft in a series of profiles. Michael Gordon in The Age called him ‚Äúthe standout performer on the Crean front bench.‚Äù

But anyone with a passing interest in Australian politics over the past two decades knows there was a persistent Russian-doll approach to leadership spills. Julia Gillard, having entered parliament at the same time as Rudd ‚Äî indeed, they gave their maiden addresses on the same day ‚Äî was being endorsed as a future leader by no less a luminary than, um, Mark Latham. Ipsos polling in 2006 put her at the top of the pile in terms of popularity.

For his part, Hastie has been a ‚Äúrising star‚Äù since at least 2017, and that description started popping up in the media again as Peter Dutton‚Äôs 2025 campaign began to falter.

 What Labor ‚Äî and Andrew Hastie in his car fetish video ‚Äî get so wrong in their manufacturing fixation
What Labor ‚Äî and Andrew Hastie in his car fetish video ‚Äî get so wrong in their manufacturing fixation
Step 2: Setting out the stall

To move things along, you gotta give the impression you‚Äôve got some big ideas up your sleeve.

Tony Abbott, though consistently less popular than then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull, offered his plans for the Liberal Party‚Äôs future in his book Battlelines, in July 2009, just under six months before his shock victory ‚Äî by a single vote ‚Äî in a leadership ballot against Turnbull.

After a very quiet election ‚Äî which looks fairly prudent with hindsight ‚Äî Hastie has been cropping up with a lot of thoughts on how things might be better for the Liberals. He recently added spice by threatening to quit the shadow frontbench if the party remains committed to a policy of net zero by 2050. More on that later.

Step 3: Gather the forces and create chaos

This is the fun part, and if you‚Äôre committed enough, this phase can last years too.

Having been offed by Gillard, Rudd set about ensuring she never had a moment‚Äôs rest. In February 2012, he quit the foreign ministry. A few days later, Gillard called a leadership spill, which she won comfortably. But that was far from the end of the matter.

The sniping reached an absurd and distasteful peak with a second spill on March 21, 2013 ‚Äî timed to overshadow Gillard‚Äôs apology to victims of forced adoption. Gillard and then deputy prime minister Wayne Swan ended up running unopposed, with Rudd having apparently decided 10 minutes before the match that he didn‚Äôt want to play. Gillard sacked ringleader Simon Crean and declared the leadership squabbles settled. They were ‚Äî and this will shock you ‚Äî not settled.

But Rudd was busy firming up some buddies to back him. In June of that year, with Labor‚Äôs polling plummeting, a pro-Rudd petition started gathering signatures backing him to save the furniture. Gillard called another spill, and this time lost 57 to 45.

This weekend, Hastie put out a slickly produced social media post lamenting the end of the Australian car industry. When anonymous colleagues went to The Australian to idly speculate what the video must have cost, Hastie responded furiously.

‚ÄúNameless cowards briefing in the paper,‚Äù he wrote on his Instagram stories above a screen cap of the article stating: ‚ÄúIt was filmed by competent, patriotic gen Z staffers you muppets.‚Äù

Hastie also had buddies ready to ‚Äúleap‚Äù to his defence, with Coalition senators Price and Matt Canavan both cited in the Nine papers calling quotes from Liberal colleagues ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù.

Further, SMH reported that ‚Äúseveral MPs unwilling to go on the record said Angus Taylor, the party‚Äôs Right faction candidate who lost a leadership ballot to Ley, had been told by close allies inside and outside parliament that Hastie was now the best candidate to take forward the conservative wing of the party, which is sceptical of Ley.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the Oz reports on the apparently growing level of support for Hastie in the Liberal Party‚Äôs right.

The perfect storm: Why immigration has become the scapegoat for our age of crisis
Step 4: Quitters sometimes win

The other great thing about being ‚Äúleadership material‚Äù is that you inevitably get a frontbench position (Hastie became shadow minister for home affairs in May 2025), which you can then quit.

Use Tony Abbott as an example. Following a wild couple of years as prime minister ‚Äî during which he‚Äôd already run against an empty chair, and only just won ‚Äî Abbott‚Äôs reign was finally ended following the disastrous optics of ‚Äúchoppergate‚Äù. Malcolm Turnbull swiftly resigned as communications minister and challenged the leadership on September 14, 2015. He won 54 to 44.

It doesn‚Äôt always work that way, however. Peter, at the time the home affairs minister, resigned from his position in August 2018 after his first unsuccessful tilt at the Liberal Party leadership. His second challenge was half successful, in that it offed Turnbull, but famously only succeeded in delivering the office to Scott Morrison.

Step 5: Media blitz

Here‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs getting serious for a conservative Liberal candidate trying to unseat a moderate: when the Oz run a piece about what your no-nonsense, hard scrabble, principled journey to get where you are.

While the August 22, 2018, piece ‚ÄúPeter Dutton‚Äôs rise and brawls‚Äù (subtitled ‚ÄúThe Brisbane battler has always been ready to give it a go‚Äù) didn‚Äôt quite have the desired effect, we will be keeping an eye out for anything similar concerning Hastie.

The Australian would have plenty of material to work from, having already catalogued his journey back to deep religious faith and colleagues‚Äô belief in him as ‚Äúa leader who offers clarity‚Äù.

Step 6: Death or glory

Finally, you pull the trigger.

Sure, it may seem like high stakes, but if there‚Äôs anything proven by Gillard‚Äôs survival of the attempts on her office in 2012 and 2013, Abbott‚Äôs in early 2015 and Turnbull a few days before he was finally axed, it‚Äôs that you can always try again.

AustralianPolitics,International student numbers plunge as government visa fees bite,"New overseas student enrolments across all four education sectors are down for the six months to July, proving the Albanese government‚Äôs concerted push to reduce numbers is finally starting to bite.

New data from the federal education department shows that overall new student enrolments in the year to June 30 were down by 16 per cent, with the English-language college sector down by 38 per cent.

Government reforms are taking effect as international student commencements head down.¬†Oscar Colman

Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, said that for the ‚Äúfirst time in living memory every sector is down‚Äù compared to the previous year.

‚ÄúClearly, the world‚Äôs highest non-refundable visa application fee is doing the government‚Äôs work for it,‚Äù Honeywood said. ‚ÄúEnglish language colleges are closing down at an alarming rate, and we are doing damage to brand Australia, particularly in our own region.‚Äù

Labor increased the non-refundable visa application fee twice in a year. The first increase was in July 2024 when the fee surged from $710 to $1600 and then again in July this year when it increased by another 25% to $2000.

While the total number of enrolments in Australia remains strong at 925,905 ‚Äì just 1.4 per cent down on last year‚Äôs historical high of 936,348 ‚Äì the total number of actual students in the country was 791,146. The difference is accounted for by the fact that many students take more than one course.

China is still the major source country for students at 23 per cent, followed by India at 17 per cent, Nepal at 8 per cent, and Vietnam and the Philippines both at 4 per cent.

Management and commerce remain the most popular study areas in higher education, followed by IT, while nearly half study at a postgraduate master‚Äôs level (48 per cent) and 37 per cent are in undergraduate programs.

In 2024, international education was still the fourth-largest export sector, after iron ore, coal and gas, bringing in $51.5 billion in revenue to the country, but experts say conflicting messages from the government continued to drive down numbers,

Luke Sheehy, chief executive of peak group Universities Australia, said new student commencements were falling short of government allocations, which set non-binding limits on how many students each university or college can enrol.

In August, the federal government said an extra 25,000 overseas students would be allowed to study in Australia in 2026, even though the number of applicants in 2025 is unlikely to reach the current cap of 270,000.

‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs decision to allocate more than 12 per cent growth next year for international numbers at universities in an acknowledgement of both the tenuous financial position of the sector ‚Äì especially in regional areas ‚Äì and the importance of the industry to the economy,‚Äù Sheehy said.

‚ÄúTo stay competitive, Australia needs stable, welcoming policy settings that give students confidence to choose us.‚Äù

Dubbed the national planning level,¬†the upwardly revised figure of 295.000¬†in 2026 comes as experts say there is little likelihood the number of new overseas student applicants will meet the lower 2025 target.

In 2024-25, there were 257,276 student visa applications from people living overseas ‚Äì lower than the two years before the pandemic. Of these, 234,040 were granted visas, according to new data from the Department of Home Affairs.

‚ÄúIt is patently clear the 270,000 commencements student cap announced for 2025 was never going to be achieved,‚Äù said migration expert Dr Abul Rizvi.

Ian Aird, chief executive of English Australia, the peak group for English language colleges, said the high visa charges, record visa refusals and the constant change and ‚Äúconfusion about what‚Äôs coming next‚Äù were affecting numbers.

‚ÄúThe number of new ELICOS-only students coming to Australia is 30 per cent lower than it was 20 years ago,‚Äù said Aird.

Aird said the huge fall in numbers had cost an estimated 3000 to 5000 jobs, and was a big hit to the local tourism market, as well as hospitality and retail sectors.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a big hit to Australia‚Äôs soft diplomacy in countries these students come from, such as France, Switzerland, Japan, Korea and Italy. In those countries, Australia is now seen by many prospective student holidaymakers as being unreasonable and just too hard.‚Äù",0.91,83,0,83,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,Inflation hits 12-month high as electricity bills surge,"**PAYWALL:**

Inflation rose to its highest rate in a year in August as state government electricity rebates expired, but the increase is unlikely to stop the Reserve Bank of Australia from cutting interest rates again this year.

Headline inflation increased to 3 per cent in August from 2.8 per cent in July, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, on the back of a 24.6 per cent annual lift in household electricity bills.

The RBA has been expecting headline inflation to temporarily rise as state and federal government electricity rebates expire and more households start to pay the full price of their energy bills rather than the lower subsidised price.

ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt said the annual rise in electricity bills was concentrated in Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, where there had been generous state-level schemes.

‚ÄúOver the year, those rebates have been used up and those programs have finished. Excluding the impact of the various changes in Commonwealth and state electricity rebates over the last year, electricity prices rose 5.9 per cent,‚Äù Marquardt said.

RBA governor Michele Bullock this week said she was focused on underlying measures of inflation rather than those subjected to temporary distortions caused by government bill relief.

Trimmed mean inflation, the RBA‚Äôs preferred measure of underlying inflation, fell to 2.6 per cent in August from 2.7 per cent in July, the ABS said.

The RBA is increasingly comfortable with the outlook for inflation, which now sits within its 2 to 3 per cent target band after several years of rapid price rises.

RBA chief economist Sarah Hunter said last week inflation was close to target and the jobs market was near full-employment.

‚ÄúSo we hope we‚Äôve achieved our mandate. But touch wood, we‚Äôre always looking at it and monitoring it,‚Äù Hunter said.

Financial markets expect the RBA to cut the official interest rate another two times by mid-2026, with the next move lower fully priced in by the board‚Äôs December 8-9 meeting.

The RBA views the monthly CPI figures as an unreliable gauge of inflation pressures compared to the quarterly data.

For now, the monthly inflation release does not measure price changes across all items in the CPI basket, and the trimmed mean is constructed differently to the quarterly data. The ABS said these limitations will be addressed from November.",0.89,63,0,63,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,Gen Z Australians want to tap super to buy housing,"Support for using superannuation to help buy a home has jumped to 60 per cent and is even higher among younger people, new polling shows, amid increased anxiety about housing affordability.

A poll by RedBridge Group found a 10 percentage point jump in support over the past 12 months, as separate focus groups confirmed a prolonged sense of despondency among voters about home ownership.

The Coalition has made it part of their housing policy that first home buyers and older women should be allowed to access up to $50,000 from their super to put towards a deposit for a home. This is despite economists warning the move would push house prices even higher.

‚ÄúIn politics, discontent now organises faster and the risk for the government is that support for this reductive policy continues to develop and creates pressure points,‚Äù said RedBridge director Tony Barry.
‚ÄúOf concern for Labor strategists is that this increase in support is mostly occurring in the Gen Z and blue-collar vote segments.‚Äù

Of those surveyed by RedBridge aged 18-34, 70 per cent agreed or strongly agreed that Australians should be able to access their super savings before retirement to purchase a home. Among blue-collar workers, 80 per cent agreed or strongly agreed.

Coalition housing spokesman Andrew Bragg said it was not surprising people wanted to use their own money to buy a home, which remained at the centre of people‚Äôs plans for a safe retirement.

‚ÄúLabor wants the super funds to be forever landlords. Australians know that is a sick and ugly priority from a government which has failed on housing,‚Äù said Bragg.

Upward pressure on prices

Economist Saul Eslake wrote a report last year for the Super Members Council on the Coalition‚Äôs proposal. On Tuesday, he said it was a terrible policy idea.

Eslake said it would reduce super fund investment returns for everyone because funds would be forced to hold more lower-returning liquid assets to cope with withdrawals by first home buyers.
‚ÄúLike every other first home buyer scheme, it will allow people to spend more on housing and put upward pressure on prices,‚Äù Eslake said.

A spokesman for Housing Minister Clare O‚ÄôNeil said the Coalition‚Äôs super for housing would exacerbate problems in housing.

‚ÄúThe immediate effect of super for housing effectively would be a dramatic increase to house prices, and a transfer of wealth from young peoples‚Äô retirement savings into the accounts of people who already have housing wealth.

‚ÄúThe Albanese government is helping more first home buyers by uncapping the 5 pr cent deposit scheme and giving every first home buyer the opportunity to purchase a home with a quarter of the savings they‚Äôd normally need.‚Äù

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced last month the government would bring forward by three months to October 1 an expanded government-backed deposit scheme to help first home buyers get into the market through free government lenders mortgage insurance.

Introduced by the Morrison government in 2020, the first home guarantee scheme allows people to enter the housing market with a 5 per cent deposit.

The federal government guarantees another 15 per cent of the purchase price, so the applicant avoids paying lenders mortgage insurance.

Labor is expanding the home guarantee from 35,000 first-time buyers (50,000 people in total, including additional places for the regions and single women) to an unlimited number of people, subject to property price caps.
By abolishing the $125,000 income limit for eligibility ($200,000 for couples), the treasury estimates it will make 70,000 people eligible in the first year from its accelerated October 1 start date.

The expanded guarantee will become available for all first purchases worth up to $1.5 million in Sydney, $950,000 in Melbourne, $1 million in Brisbane and Canberra, $850,000 in Perth, $900,000 in Adelaide, and $700,000 in Hobart.

Eslake said Labor‚Äôs scheme would also put upward pressure on prices, but not as much as the Coalition‚Äôs super for housing policy.

Treasury has advised the government the scheme would have a very minor upward impact on home prices of about 0.5 per cent over six years. This includes supply benefits putting downward pressure on prices from Labor‚Äôs plan to build 55,000 additional affordable and social homes.

Liberal frontbencher Andrew Hastie has slammed his colleagues as ‚Äúnameless cowards‚Äù and ‚Äúmuppets‚Äù for anonymously briefing the media over his campaign for Coalition environmental policy change.
Hastie, an outspoken opponent of the goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, lashed out on social media after unnamed colleagues told The Australian he should tone down his ambitions. His outburst comes as the opposition conducts a review of the party‚Äôs energy policy.

In a post on Instagram stories late on Monday, Hastie captioned a screenshot of an anonymous quote with the words, ‚Äúnameless cowards briefing in the paper‚Äù.

The screenshot referred to a criticism of Hastie standing next to a vintage car in an Instagram video at the weekend, commenting that the footage was ‚Äúwell produced‚Äù and questioning who was helping the MP or how he was paying for the production on a ‚Äúmodest‚Äù parliament salary.
‚ÄúIt was filmed by competent, patriotic Gen Z staffers, you muppets,‚Äù retorted Hastie.

On Tuesday, Nationals Senator Matt Canavan and Liberal Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, both of whom back Hastie‚Äôs scepticism of net zero targets, rose to his defence in a sign of deepening schisms over the direction of Coalition policies.
‚ÄúThe most frustrating thing in politics is the cowards that don‚Äôt put their name to comments,‚Äù said Canavan on Facebook.
‚ÄúI have no issue with people disagreeing with me, but I really can‚Äôt stand people that snipe without even having the guts to do so in the open. Good on you Hastie for calling this BS out!‚Äù
Jacinta Price weighs in
Price, who was recently at the centre of a bitter internal argument over her controversial comments about Indian migrants to Australia, weighed in, condemning MPs who did not dare to own their own comments.
‚ÄúIt seems like the factional warlords are in overdrive with their pathetic backgrounding efforts to undermine a debate our country must have,‚Äù she said on social media.
‚ÄúAndrew Hastie asks an important question, ‚Äúwhat sort of a country do we want to be?‚Äù

The latest internal Coalition stoush, one of several blow-ups as the opposition seeks to redefine itself after an election hammering, comes as Hastie ‚Äì widely viewed as having leadership potential ‚Äì openly campaigns for policy change on energy, industry and migration.
An Instagram post on Saturday where he stood in front of a vintage car promoting the slogan ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Make Things Again‚Äù using an ‚ÄúAustralians First‚Äù tagline, stoked speculation about his leadership ambitions.
Hastie, however, said that people had ‚Äúmissed the deeper point‚Äù, explaining that the post was intended to convey how little industrial capacity Australia had and its consequent vulnerability to a strategic shock.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs really amusing to me is the so-called economic supply-siders backing the massive green grift at the heart of the net zero scam,‚Äù he said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe supply-siders say they are for free markets, yet they are distorting our energy market with all the grift, and killing off Aussie businesses and industry in the process,‚Äù he added.

Andrew Hastie‚Äôs colleagues have urged the Liberal frontbencher to ease up on his personal campaign for policy change, saying the party should be focused on rebuilding.
Mr Hastie this month launched a campaign to change the direction of Liberal Party policy on ¬≠energy, industry, migration and families with a video demanding Australia ‚Äúmake things‚Äù, using an ‚ÄúAustralians first‚Äù tagline in his pitch.

Fellow Liberal MPs and economists criticised the intervention ‚Äì which was made well ahead of the release of the party‚Äôs 2025 election review ‚Äì as being purely ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù and risky.

Several MPs who spoke to The Australian all expressed their ¬≠desire for Mr Hastie to think again about his personal campaign, which includes both policy ideas and a publicly acknowledged ¬≠desire for leadership.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what Andrew (Hastie) is doing or up to, but the events of last week with the ¬≠national climate risk assessment and 2035 targets, all of which have no costs provided ‚Äì the government really has given us some stuff to try jump on,‚Äù one Liberal MP said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we should be ¬≠focused right now.‚Äù

Independent economist Saul Eslake said the demand to have products like cars made in Aus¬≠tralia was ideological and would require major market intervention to ever achieve.
‚ÄúUnless you want to have an economy by Stalin and determined by five-year plans rather than what consumers want to spend money on, this doesn‚Äôt work,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúWhen you combine Andrew Hastie with Angus Taylor, it shows how desperately short of economic talent the party is.‚Äù

The Coalition faced major ¬≠criticism after the 2025 election, ahead of which Mr Taylor was the opposition Treasury spokesman, for failing to provide a compelling economic platform to pitch to voters.

Former Liberal senator Hollie Hughes discusses the potential of Shadow Minister for Home Affairs Andrew Hastie becoming Leader of the Opposition. ‚ÄúThey need to stop talking about themselves, for a start,‚Äù Ms Hughes told Sky News host Rowan Dean. ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äôs made it very clear he wants to be leader at some point ‚Ä¶ does he want to be leader now ‚Ä¶ or in the future?‚Äù

During that campaign, ¬≠Coalition senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price also controversially ¬≠declared that the next government must ‚Äúmake Australia great again‚Äù in an echo of Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù catchcry.
She later backtracked on the comment.
However, Mr Hastie‚Äôs colleagues questioned whether he was also ‚Äúgetting his lines‚Äù from the same place as Senator Price ‚Äì who this month was demoted from the frontbench after comments on Indian migrants generally voting for Labor ‚Äì and that the source of those ‚Äúlines‚Äù was from outside of the Liberal Party.


‚ÄúThat (group) are the same ¬≠encouragers, the same people feeding lines and who ‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt in the Liberal Party but are influencing some MPs,‚Äù one senior Liberal MP said.
‚ÄúThe problem is, those lines are popular with the base but not the broader country.‚Äù
Another Liberal MP said Mr Hastie‚Äôs policy pitch, which was accompanied by a video featuring the former soldier standing next to a vintage car, was obviously ‚Äúwell produced‚Äù and questioned who was helping the WA MP.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to wonder how it‚Äôs all being organised. A federal ¬≠parliament salary is modest,‚Äù the MP said.
Another source said Mr Hastie was ‚Äúreading right from the Tony Abbott playbook‚Äù when it came to his conduct.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt disagree with what he‚Äôs proposing when it comes to the points made around energy security and national security ‚Ä¶ but some of this is harking back to a bygone era,‚Äù one MP said.
‚ÄúOne question I have is the politics of it, the seats this would actually work in and how this gets them back voting for us.‚Äù
Sky News host Chris Kenny discusses Shadow Minister for Home Affairs Andrew Hastie‚Äôs potential withdrawal from the Liberal Party frontbench. ‚ÄúAndrew Hastie has called out the net-zero farce, saying he‚Äôd resign if the Coalition again adopted a net-zero target,‚Äù Mr Kenny said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs revealed today that most Liberal MPs don‚Äôt agree with him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a worry.‚Äù

Responding to the criticism from within the party and economists, Mr Hastie said he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmind copping a whack over the head with their dog-eared copies of Hayek ‚Äì it proves that I‚Äôve shaken them up‚Äù.
‚ÄúPeople have missed the deeper point: we have very little industrial capacity in this country, and we are incredibly vulnerable to a ¬≠strategic shock as a consequence. Why shouldn‚Äôt we be able to make things here like we once did? Why shouldn‚Äôt we use our ¬≠energy abundance to our advantage?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in luck; I ¬≠believe in taking action to win. ¬≠Taiwan isn‚Äôt a world-leader in microchips by accident ‚Äì they chose to make it their comparative ¬≠advantage.
‚ÄúWe have a choice to make in Australia: become more dependent on China, or take control of our future by investing in our industrial base.‚Äù

Mr Hastie described those worried about market intervention as ‚Äúfree-market fundamentalists‚Äù who had ‚Äúblind faith‚Äù in their neo-liberal models.
‚ÄúThey work in abstractions, dislocated from the realities of life for many Australians‚Äù he said.

AustralianPolitics,Anthony Albanese snubbed from Donald Trump‚Äôs official meeting schedule in New York,"Michael Koziol | The Sydney Morning Herald

**New York:**¬†Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been snubbed from Donald Trump‚Äôs official schedule of meetings in New York, leaving him to compete for a handshake with the US president at a reception with more than 100 other world leaders.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president‚Äôs schedule at the United Nations would include bilateral meetings with the UN Secretary-General and the presidents of Ukraine, Argentina and the European Union.

Trump will also attend a multilateral meeting with the leaders of an array of Middle Eastern countries, Turkey, Pakistan and Indonesia.

But Australia and Albanese were omitted from the schedule, despite earlier suggestions from both sides that a bilateral meeting was possible on the sidelines of the summit.

The Australian government had in recent days played down the prospect of a formal one-on-one with Trump.

He will still have the opportunity to meet the president in person at a reception Trump is hosting on Tuesday night (Wednesday AEST) that Leavitt said would be attended by more than 100 world leaders.

After that, Trump will return to Washington, where he is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting and lunch with Turkish President Recep Erdoƒüan on Thursday.

‚ÄúWe will meet when we meet,‚Äù Albanese told the ABC last week. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a range of events occurring ‚Ä¶ that means people‚Äôs arrangements will be finalised when they‚Äôre finalised.‚Äù

At a briefing, Leavitt also said Trump took a dim view of the move by Australia, Canada, the UK and France to officially¬†[recognise a Palestinian state](https://archive.is/o/3zbC4/https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5mwoj)¬†at this week‚Äôs UN summit.

""The president has been very clear: he disagrees with this decision,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe feels this does not do anything to release the hostages, which is the primary goal right now in Gaza.‚Äú

""\[It\] does nothing to end this conflict and bring this war to a close, and frankly, he believes it‚Äôs a reward to Hamas. He believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies.‚Äù

Leavitt said Trump would have more to say about the matter when he addresses the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.

The president will also ‚Äúarticulate his straightforward and constructive vision for the world‚Äù, she said, and touch upon ‚Äúhow globalist institutions have significantly decayed the world order‚Äù.",0.92,162,0,162,en-AU

AustralianPolitics,Sydney housing crisis: Left split as Inner West YIMBYs and NIMBYs debate high density plan,"Tempers started to fray just four speeches into a marathon town hall meeting to debate Australia‚Äôs housing future, as residents of Sydney‚Äôs inner west began to suspect the fix was in.

Inner West Council had gathered on Monday evening to consider the Fairer Future plan for 30,000 new homes in the area over the next 15 years, but despite a community consultation suggesting most were opposed to high density, speakers lined up one by one to praise the plan.



YIMBYs showed up to an Inner West Council meeting to put the case for increased housing. Max Mason-Hubers

Around Australia, local communities are debating how best to solve the housing crisis and what share of the 1.2 million five-year home building target their area might accommodate. With rents and home prices soaring, the stakes are high and so are emotions.

One young YIMBY (Yes in My Backyard) advocate, Tim Bradshaw, said he was ‚Äúdisappointed by those who want more housing, but it‚Äôs always ‚Äònot like that‚Äô‚Äù.

Labor Mayor Darcy Byrne riled up the crowd by praising the excellent speeches, as another young YIMBY warned against becoming ‚Äúinsular‚Äù like Sydney‚Äôs Northern Beaches.

Those opposed to the plan, including Better Futures Coalition spokesman John Stamolis, began to interject, demanding an explanation of the speaking order. Purely in the order they registered, Byrne and council workers replied.

Justin Simon and Emily Lockwood, the founders of Sydney YIMBY, revealed they made police complaints about alleged harassment they had received for their advocacy.

Contributions were met with groans as successive speakers rose in YIMBY shirts, with particular vitriol directed at a few residents from out of area.

Harrison Chudley, of Enmore in the inner west, said it was unfair that areas in Sydney‚Äôs North Shore were not pulling their weight. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre better than them, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù he posed. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied one attendee.

Bruce Scott, of Leichhardt, got a loud cheer for declaring his opposition to the plan ‚Äì only to reveal he did so because he wanted even more density, like the 10,000 homes slated for Woollahra and Edgecliff in Sydney‚Äôs inner east.

Rob Beckett, of Marrickville, warned that without more density the inner west would become a ‚Äúretirement village for wealthy empty-nesters like Mosman or Haberfield‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the diversity that makes the inner west great, not the bricks and mortar ‚Äì and that‚Äôs what we should be fighting for.‚Äù

Eventually those opposed got their turn. The debate pitched those who labelled it a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù and ‚Äútrickle-down economics‚Äù to believe that more supply would decrease home prices against those who derided ‚Äúsupply denialism‚Äù, likening it to climate change denial.

Those opposed to the plan advocated for more public or affordable housing, denying being NIMBYs while nevertheless relying on arguments about lack of green space and inappropriate density.

Greens members were split: younger YIMBYs warned that fewer apartments in the inner west would mean more koala habitat cut down for greenfield development at the urban fringe; older environmentalists, like former NSW Greens convenor Hall Greenland, warned at a demonstration outside about the embodied carbon and waste involved in knocking down old buildings for new.



Hall Greenland spoke against the housing plan outside the Inner West Council meeting. Max Mason-Hubers

But then, so was Labor. Julian, from Labor for Ending Homelessness, said the 2 per cent reserved for affordable housing should be raised to 15 per cent. That‚Äôs closer to the Greens‚Äô demand for 30 per cent, but would require tall towers to be feasible, according to Atlas Economics modelling.

The battle for the urban future defied neat categorisation by age. Younger socialists, like Edward Dan, labelled the plan a ‚Äútotal betrayal‚Äù that would ‚Äúimmediately screw over those in rental housing‚Äù.

Eugenie Wilson, an elderly resident of Ashfield, quoted from Domain to warn that ‚Äúcashed-up buyers are moving in from the eastern suburbs‚Äù after being priced out of Rose Bay, Double Bay and Bondi.

Those opposed returned to two themes: greedy developers, and apartments costing more than $1 million.

But as several YIMBY speakers noted, those cashed-up buyers do not disappear because a particular community refuses an ambitious housing target. They simply outbid existing residents, driving up sale prices and rents, forcing families to move interstate or to regional areas.

Speakers opposed focused on the local housing target being double what the Minns government has proposed in its low and mid-rise policy and transport-oriented development zones. These infill policies slate the area for greater density due to the conversion of the Sydenham to Bankstown line to metro rail and the construction of Metro West, due to open by 2032.

Stamolis and several other speakers suggested the NSW Labor government was pulling the strings on council, on which Labor has a majority. Labor seems too eager, they said, to turn the inner west into an ideological testing ground for YIMBY vs NIMBY fights that could be an important frame for the 2027 state election.

NSW‚Äôs share of the national target is 377,000 homes in the next five years. The state has booming apartment approvals, but is not on track to meet its target.

The premier Chris Minns has said housing solutions around the city may ‚Äúruffle feathers‚Äù, as it has done in the inner east where a tripling of density and completion of Woollahra station is vigorously opposed by local Liberals.

The inner west stoush shows that the politics of the housing crisis will not just fuel Liberal-Labor disputes, but also split the left. Speaker after speaker on both sides wanted a future that is equitable, inclusive and diverse. They just couldn‚Äôt agree what shape and mode of housing ownership will get us there.",0.85,29,0,29,en-AU

In a video released on social media by Andrew Hastie on September 20, 2025, he demands Australia ‚Äòmake things‚Äô and criticises previous Liberal policy on the car industry. Picture: Instagram

There is a variety of reasons to query the government objective of net zero by 2050, but bringing back car manufacturing to Australia is not one of them.

Coalition frontbencher Andrew Hastie is living on another planet if he thinks a fossil fuel-dominated electricity grid would be enough to persuade large-scale investment in local manufacture of passenger motor vehicles. It‚Äôs among several subjects he raises in a bizarre video that appears to be a veiled tilt at the Liberal leadership.

As for describing locally made vehicles as ‚Äúbeautiful pieces of craftsmanship‚Äù ‚Äì give me a break. My parents had a series of Holden sedans and station wagons. They were terrible cars that always started to fall apart before they were traded in. By the late 1970s, they had given up on Australian-made cars, preferring instead the much higher-quality imported ones.

Even more hilarious is Hastie‚Äôs suggestion that ‚Äúcompetition drove innovation in our industry‚Äù.

Would that be competition behind massive tariff barriers, quotas and government handouts? The car industry was one of the most coddled industries Australia has ever had, second only to textiles, clothing and footwear.

Let‚Äôs think of the basic facts. The Australian car industry was completely dominated by overseas companies, American and Japanese. They came here because the extraordinarily high tariff barriers imposed by successive governments meant local manu¬≠facturing was the only way to access the local market.



Former Liberal senator Hollie Hughes discusses the potential of shadow minister for home affairs Andrew Hastie becoming leader of the opposition. ‚ÄúThey need to stop talking about themselves, for a start,‚Äù Senator Hughes told Sky News host Rowan Dean. ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äôs made it very clear he wants to be leader at some point ‚Ä¶ does he want to be leader now ‚Ä¶ or in the future?‚Äù

At first, there was a view that tariffs could be temporary ‚Äì the infant industry argument ‚Äì but each time governments attempted to wean the industry off high protection, there were complaints and threats of exit. Car industry executives excelled at seeking rents from Canberra even if they were not particularly good at meeting the preferences of consumers.

It took the Hawke-Keating government to sound the final siren on this racket. In conjunction with attempts to improve the competitiveness of the industry by becoming export-focused ‚Äì that failed ‚Äì as well as providing transition assistance for affected workers, the protection the industry enjoyed was slowly wound back.

Over time, all the overseas-owned manufacturers pulled out. The last one was Toyota, which had produced a reasonably popular car, the Camry. But the thicket of costly and untenable industrial relations arrangements ‚Äì the rents had always spilt over to high pay for workers and extremely inflexible industrial relations arrangements ‚Äì forced the hand of senior executives back in Japan. The cost of energy at the time was not a determining factor in the closure of the factories.

The collapse of the local car industry occurred under both Labor and Coalition governments. The case for free, open markets was a bipartisan proposition that held sway for some three decades.

So how should we interpret Hastie‚Äôs corny social media release? He tells us he doesn‚Äôt want us to become ‚Äúa nation of flat-white makers‚Äù but rather he wants us to design and ‚Äúmake complex things‚Äù and ‚Äúbuild things with our own hands‚Äù. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs not just about the cars‚Äù, according to the high-profile member of the Coalition.

Does Hastie have a point, even though he is way off base when it comes to the car industry? There is no doubt energy costs are a critical factor in determining the competitiveness of certain industry sectors ‚Äì think here metal refining and smelting, steelmaking, concrete and cement, fertiliser.

Many of these activities are undertaken here because, in the past, relatively cheap and affordable power offset the high labour costs that our system of industrial relations imposes. The investments have been made, and the owners are likely to run them down.

If serious operating losses ensue in the meantime, the first port of call is to governments to provide subsidies to keep these operations going. This is already happening ‚Äì think here the Nyrstar smelters in Tasmania and South Australia, the Whyalla steelworks, the Mount Isa copper smelter, and all the aluminium smelters, to varying degrees.

While the Prime Minister and the Climate Change and Energy Minister repeat the myth on high rotation that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, the sad reality is that both industrial and residential electricity ¬≠prices continue to soar ‚Äì up by more than one-third in the past decade.

Hastie would be well advised to give up his ignorant defence of local car manufacturing and concentrate on the rising cost of energy driving out local activities for which we can have a natural comparative advantage, in part because of the location of related ore bodies. It would also be helpful if he were to critique Labor‚Äôs misguided policy of directing investment through schemes such as the Nat¬≠ional Reconstruction Fund.

This sort of policy is always a highway to failure as governments simply don‚Äôt have the information (or indeed incentives) to guide investment in the same way as market forces.

Just consider the commercial disaster of the National Broadband Network as a case in point, as well as all those disastrous years of state government experiments in active industry policy ‚Äì WA Inc and the Victorian Economic Development Corporation are two examples.

Chris Bowen opens a new EV charging station.

Chris Bowen opens a new EV charging station.

We are never going to have any local car manufacturing at scale. Indeed, many European and US car companies are now struggling, having drunk the Kool-Aid on the switch to electric vehicles and are now being seriously outcompeted by Chinese manufacturers. The reluctance of the senior leadership team at Toyota to focus on EVs now looks prescient.

The more worrying aspect of Hastie‚Äôs bonkers intervention is the clear trend among conservative/right-wing politicians to ditch their belief in free markets and open international competition.

You can see this happening in Britain under Reform‚Äôs leader, Nigel Farage, and in France under the National Rally‚Äôs leader, Marine Le Pen. These two influential politicians also have no time for fiscal rectitude or repair. They strongly argue the case for more government handouts for their preferred constituencies and strongly oppose any attempt to cut entitlements. Contrast this with the Howard-Costello years in which budget surpluses were the norm and government debt was fully paid off.

The debate on whether we should persist with the costly and unachievable net zero by 2050 is well worth having. And let‚Äôs point out here that there are clear signs that enthusiasm around the world is rapidly evaporating for what is essentially a holy grail ‚Äì gosh, even the Europeans cannot agree on a target for 2035.

But let‚Äôs not cloak this debate in false premises that have an alarmingly protectionist feel to them. Campaigning for free and open markets and a limited role for governments is the preferred path.",0.8,40,0,40,en-AU
AustralianPolitics,"Sussan Ley writes to US Republicans, opposing the recognition of Palestine as Anthony Albanese visits New York for UN General Assembly","Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has written directly to Donald Trump‚Äôs Republican allies to say most Australians oppose Prime Minister Anthony Albanese‚Äôs decision to recognise Palestine, throwing a spanner in the works of his high-wire diplomatic mission to the US.

The unorthodox move to make clear internationally the opposition‚Äôs rejection of Australian foreign policy came after 25 senior congressional Republicans wrote to Albanese ‚Äì and leaders of France, Britain and Canada ‚Äì threatening unspecific ‚Äúpunitive measures‚Äù for jointly recognising Palestine.

The¬†letter from Republican lawmakers¬†upped the stakes for Albanese as he arrived in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. The forum is being used by long-time allies of Israel to elevate the Palestinian cause partly in protest at the Israeli government‚Äôs military campaign.

At the same time, the prime minister is working to secure a meeting with Trump, possibly at a welcome dinner hosted by the president on Wednesday morning AEST.

Australia‚Äôs pro-Palestine stance is one of several points of difference with the US administration, which argues the recognition campaign encourages Hamas.

‚ÄúGiven the concerns raised I write to reassure you, and the Congress, that this decision taken at this  
time by the Labor government does not enjoy bipartisan support here in Australia,‚Äù Ley wrote in her letter to Republicans, including former presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, senators Rick Scott and Tom Cotton, and Elise Stefanik, Trump‚Äôs original choice to serve as US ambassador to the UN.

Ley added: ‚ÄúThe federal opposition opposes this decision and would reverse it should we form government.‚Äù

Ley‚Äôs call to intervene from Australian shores reflects the depth of domestic disagreement over Gaza.

‚ÄúIt is also important to note it does not reflect the view of a majority of Australians. According to the  
reputable Resolve Political Monitor, just 24 per cent of Australians support recognising Palestine,‚Äù she said in the letter, provided to this masthead.

In the August poll cited by Ley, Resolve reported that while a quarter of voters support Australia recognising a Palestinian state regardless of who holds power in Gaza, a third said recognition should wait until key conditions are met.

In September,¬†Australians were evenly split on Albanese‚Äôs plan¬†to recognise Palestine at the UN meeting, with 29 per cent of Australians supporting and opposing the move respectively.

Forty-two per cent said they were unsure or had no opinion, suggesting the issue is not a high priority for many voters.

Other polls not cited by Ley, conducted by pollsters Essential and DemosAU with differently worded questions, have recently found higher support for recognition.

‚ÄúIn this time of global uncertainty I want to affirm that millions of Australians remain committed to our enduring friendship with the United States and our alliance,‚Äù Ley said. ‚ÄúWe cannot allow our relationship to drift, which we have unfortunately seen under our current prime minister, including on the matter you have raised.‚Äù

Ley finished her letter by stating her intention to travel to the US for talks in December.

In July, Albanese slammed¬†Coalition figures¬†for attacking his trip to China, suggesting they were breaking with convention to criticise a prime minister overseas.

The Coalition is opposed to the government‚Äôs decision to use recognition as a tool to spark an elusive peace process. Previously, both parties viewed Palestinian statehood as the end result of a peace process when borders were agreed.

The US lawmakers‚Äô letter said: ‚ÄúProceeding with recognition will put your country at odds with longstanding US policy and interests and may invite punitive measures in response.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a reckless policy that undermines prospects for peace,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúIt sets the dangerous precedent that violence, not diplomacy, is the most expedient means for terrorist groups like Hamas.‚Äù",0.93,149,0,149,en-AU

**Richard Ferguson**


Israel‚Äôs foreign minister has told Sussan Ley that Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs government appreciates her opposition to a Palestinian state and her pledge to reverse Labor‚Äôs Middle East policies.
In an extraordinary dialogue between an opposition leader and a foreign government, Ms Ley has told the Jewish Homeland‚Äôs top diplomat Gideon Sa‚Äôar that she will oppose Anthony Albanese‚Äôs ‚Äòreckless‚Äô moves on Palestine.
It comes after Ms Ley also wrote to a group of 25 Republican legistators in the US, imploring to not judge Australia on the Prime Minister‚Äôs Palestinian recognition push.
After months of criticisms against Mr Albanese, Mr Sa‚Äôar said on X that Ms Ley had been invited to Israel and that his government backed her pushback on recognition.


‚ÄúI expressed our appreciation for her position opposing the Government of Australia‚Äôs recent decision and for her announcement that, should there be a change of government in Australia, this decision would be reversed,‚Äù Mr Sa‚Äôar said.

‚ÄúI outlined to her Israel‚Äôs objectives in the war in Gaza and the major efforts being made to enable the continued flow of humanitarian assistance under challenging conditions.

‚ÄúI stressed that Israel is well aware of the many friends it has in Australia and distinguishes between the Government and the people of Australia.‚Äù



Ms Ley - who was a frequent critic of Israel until the October 7 massacres - said she also voiced her concerns to Israel about antisemitism in Australia.

‚ÄúI expressed my disappointment at this break with bipartisanship and reiterated the Coalition‚Äôs long-held position that recognition must only come at the end of a genuine two-state process. Now is the wrong time while Hamas holds hostages and while conflict still rages,‚Äù she said on X.

‚ÄúI voiced concerns for Australia‚Äôs Jewish community, the rise of antisemitism, and the humanitarian toll of the conflict. I also expressed my hope for the safe return of hostages and a ceasefire as soon as possible.

‚ÄúThe Coalition will continue to stand firmly with Israel and oppose reckless decisions that reward terrorists.‚Äù

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese justifies the decision for Australia, the UK and Canada to officially recognise Palestine as a sovereign state. ‚ÄúThis is a positive move forward,‚Äù Mr Albanese told Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just continue to have a cycle of violence with wars, with conflict, with ongoing insecurity.‚Äù Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised this decision, calling it an ‚Äúabsurd price for terrorism‚Äù.
Ms Ley wrote to Donald Trump‚Äôs allies in congress imploring them not to punish Australia for Labor‚Äôs recognition of Palestine, saying she will reverse the decision if she wins the next election and claiming the government overestimates support for a Palestinian state.

In a letter to the likes of Texas conservative Ted Cruz, New York GOP rising star Elise Stefanik and Florida senator Rick Scott, Ms Ley has told the Republicans the Prime Minister‚Äôs backing for a Palestinian state lacks deep support in parliament and with the public.
‚ÄúGiven the concerns raised, I write to reassure you, and the congress, that this decision taken at this time by the Labor government does not enjoy bipartisan support here in Australia. The federal opposition opposes this decision and would reverse it should we form government,‚Äù she writes.
‚ÄúIt is also important to note it does not reflect the view of a majority of Australians. As you have noted in your letter, Hamas still holds Israeli hos¬≠tages, seized during the terrorist massacres of 7 October 2023. Hamas, which is a listed terrorist organisation in Australia, is still in power in Gaza and continues to attack Israel. The Palestinian people can see no hope of democratic self-governance while Hamas is in power.‚Äù

In their open letter, the 25 Republicans urged Mr Albanese to abandon plans to legitimise a Palestinian state. Warning the ‚Äúreckless policy‚Äù could trigger a further rise of anti-Semitism in Australia, they said the move ‚Äúsets the dangerous precedent that violence, not diplomacy, is the most expedient means for terrorist groups like Hamas to achieve their political aims‚Äù.
The Republicans‚Äô letter was forwarded to Mr Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Ms Ley‚Äôs letter is one of several recent moves to solidify Coalition support for Israel and move past her own history of strident criticisms of the Israeli government.


The Liberal leader also tells the Republican congressional leaders she will be in Washington in December, in her first major overseas trip since taking over the leadership from Peter Dutton after May‚Äôs shocking election wipeout.
‚ÄúIn this time of global uncertainty I want to affirm that millions of Australians remain committed to our enduring friendship with the United States and our alliance,‚Äù Ms Ley writes.


‚ÄúWe cannot allow our relationship to drift, which we have unfortun¬≠ately seen under our current Prime Minister, including on the matter you have raised.
‚ÄúIn response to that, I believe in-person engagement and dialogue across the leadership of our two nations is now vitally important to bring ballast to our great partnership.



‚ÄúWith this in mind, I will be travelling to the United States later this year to discuss Australia‚Äôs national interests and the mutual objectives of our alliance.‚Äù
Mr Albanese on Sunday (Monday AEST) brushed off the Republican concerns. ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs not surprising that some people will have different views,‚Äù he told the Nine Network.
‚ÄúSome people in Australia will have different views. People in Israel have different views on the Middle East as well.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve had good discussions with President Trump and one of the things about the United States‚Äô position and President Trump‚Äôs position is that he consistently is an advocate for peace rather than war.‚Äù

AustralianPolitics,Triple Zero Victoria emergency call service cutting jobs for ‚Äòbudget repair‚Äô,"Triple Zero Victoria is again in turmoil after dozens of jobs were cut from the essential service and the number of Victorians waiting more than a minute to connect to an ambulance call-taker rose to its highest levels since the tail end of the pandemic.

In recent months, there have been about 40 redundancies at the agency, according to internal staff briefings, employees and ambulance, firefighters and communication workers‚Äô unions.

Whistleblowers and unions are warning that Triple Zero Victoria is again unprepared to handle a major surge in calls ‚Äì or even a ‚Äúbusy Monday‚Äù ‚Äì as forecasting and training jobs are slashed in the name of what internal briefings term ‚Äúbudget repair‚Äù.

Thirty-three people, including several children, died after Triple Zero faced a COVID-19 crisis underfunded and understaffed. It meant tens of thousands of calls seeking assistance for the desperately ill or injured went unanswered or faced excruciatingly long waits.

Fresh concerns about the resilience of Victoria‚Äôs emergency call-answering service during a surge come as at least three people died, in South Australia and Western Australia, during an Optus outage last week. A failed network update meant some Triple Zero calls went unanswered. Emergency calls were offline for nearly 14 hours in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and parts of NSW.

On Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Optus‚Äô failure to prevent the outage was ‚Äúclearly unacceptable‚Äù.

At Triple Zero Victoria, many of the cuts have come from the teams charged with forecasting demand on the service, such as weather conditions that might cause a spike in calls, and ensuring there are enough call-takers rostered on at any one time, the unions said.

Other cuts have been made in human resources, IT and training teams.

The organisation has about 1200 full-time equivalent staff, including 920 operational staff, a July briefing note said, while last year‚Äôs annual report showed there were 379 non-operational and support staff. The cuts have come from the latter group.

Internal documents show that among the roles cut are 25 jobs ‚Äúdiscontinued‚Äù in the organisation‚Äôs Emergency Communication Information Services, which Triple Zero Victoria says helps in ‚Äúsupporting tens of thousands of emergency field responders‚Äù.

Also among the redundancies was the manager of demand and real time, responsible for demand modelling and capacity planning. A review that followed the pandemic call-taking collapse found that the service had successfully forecast the record surge in calls but had not been properly funded to respond to demand it had modelled.

‚ÄúIn my 31 years of being a union official, I‚Äôve never come across an organisation that is in so much turmoil, and I‚Äôve seen a lot,‚Äù said John Ellery, assistant secretary of the Communications Workers Union.

‚ÄúTriple Zero are responding to cuts in funding from the Victorian government. And the response that is there is really all about slashing underlying costs ‚Äì that just means jobs.‚Äù

The job cuts come as data obtained by this masthead through freedom-of-information laws shows almost 700 callers (689) waited more than a minute for their emergency ambulance calls to be answered in May.

The number of Triple Zero callers waiting more than a minute to be connected to an ambulance call-taker has been rising.

It is the highest number since August 2022, representing 0.75 per cent of emergency ambulance calls.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll say that they‚Äôre meeting their KPIs, but that‚Äôs 700 people in enormous terror at a time when they desperately need to get through to someone,‚Äù said Victorian Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a child who‚Äôs choking, a minute feels like an hour ‚Ä¶ In a heart attack, time is muscle. In a stroke, time is brain tissue. And those additional minutes do make a big difference in the chances of a person‚Äôs survival or their recovery.‚Äù

Hill said he was uncertain if the service could comfortably cope with ‚Äúa busy Monday‚Äù, let alone another pandemic.

Triple Zero Victoria is required to answer 90 per cent of emergency ambulance calls within five seconds each month.

It was meeting this benchmark early in the pandemic before a rapid decline in performance, when the number of calls answered within five seconds fell as low as 39 per cent. One person was forced to wait more than 76 minutes for their emergency call to be answered.

After a massive injection of funds, the number of calls answered within five seconds rebounded to almost 99 per cent in July 2023, but since then, there has been a slow decline.

Leaked internal data shows performance fell to 92 per cent and 93.8 per cent in June and July this year.

In May, more than 2700 emergency police calls took more than a minute to be answered.

In the years leading up to the COVID-19 Triple Zero crisis, the Victorian government failed to act on numerous warnings of the agency‚Äôs precarious financial position.

The crisis spurred the government to pledge $333 million to hire more than 400 new workers. It also prompted two reviews, including one from the then inspector-general for emergency management, Tony Pearce, who warned the government‚Äôs response had not delivered a sustainable funding model for the service.

‚ÄúThey talk about $333 million ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fine, but again, it only provides resources to \[the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority\] for a four-year period,‚Äù Pearce said in September 2022.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good enough, that‚Äôs a short-term fix. In four years‚Äô time if you don‚Äôt finish the work on that model, you will be back in the same place you are now.‚Äù

Three years later, a presentation outlining cuts to training staff linked the job losses to ‚Äúbudget repair‚Äù and ‚Äúgreater efficiencies‚Äù, and the government characterised the previous boost to the agency‚Äôs budget as ‚Äúone-off surge funding‚Äù.

While the redundancies have targeted support roles, rather than call-takers, four current or former staff members said the cuts had decimated whole teams with vital roles, including workforce planning, and their loss was already being felt on the front line.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen days where teams are turning up and they‚Äôve got half the team with leave approved, and we‚Äôre having to scramble to backfill,‚Äù one call-taker said.

Some who had lost their jobs were also trained to answer calls, so they could be called in as back-up during high demand.

‚ÄúIf we had a surge event or something unplanned that was significant, they would just come back on the floor,‚Äù another call-taker said.

Emergency Services Minister Vicki Ward did not respond directly to questions about the redundancies but said the number of frontline staff at Triple Zero Victoria had increased every year since 2021.

‚ÄúTriple Zero Victoria plan every single day for surge capacity, and they have the appropriate resources in place to meet increased demand,‚Äù Ward said.

In a statement, the government said any assertion that changes to staff would limit Triple Zero Victoria‚Äôs ability to take emergency calls was incorrect.

The agency has a large annual turnover of frontline staff, who have to manage traumatic life-and-death scenarios, often daily. Internal documents show the service has lost 165 call-takers, dispatchers and team leaders in the year to July, and hired 167 new call-takers. At the start of September, as staff continued to leave after taking redundancy packages, the government announced $25 million to recruit 50 new call-takers and dispatchers.

Unions and the Victorian opposition said the fresh funding challenges facing the service were particularly galling in the light of the billions raised for emergency services from Victorians via a levy on their council rates to ‚Äúsupport the vital work‚Äù of organisations like Triple Zero Victoria.

‚ÄúVictoria is going to have one of the worst fire seasons that it‚Äôs had, so Triple Zero Victoria is going to need every staff member it has ‚Äì and while there may not be a reduction in frontline call-takers, the knee bone is connected to the thigh bone, so if they lose those support staff, the joint is going to fall over,‚Äù said United Firefighters Union state secretary Peter Marshall.

Hill, from the ambulance union, said workers at Triple Zero were ‚Äúnot just worried about the next mass catastrophe, you‚Äôre worried about the next busy night shift, or the next time there‚Äôs a high pollen count and you get a thunderstorm asthma‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt can be business-as-usual busy, and that‚Äôs enough to tip the system over the edge.‚Äù

Asked why there was a growing number of emergency ambulance calls waiting more than a minute, a Triple Zero Victoria spokesperson didn‚Äôt directly answer the question.

‚ÄúTriple Zero Victoria has been meeting emergency ambulance call answer benchmarks since August 2022, including in May 2025, and the community can be reassured that Triple Zero call-takers are there for them in an emergency,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

The opposition‚Äôs emergency services spokesman, Danny O‚ÄôBrien, said the Allan government had ‚Äúlearned nothing from the disastrous triple-zero crisis of a few years ago when Victorians literally died because of the failures of the system‚Äù.

‚ÄúThis is the dividend of poor economic management ‚Äì a government that can‚Äôt manage money and it‚Äôs Victorians paying the price through job cuts at a crucial organisation such as Triple Zero Victoria.‚Äù

AustralianPolitics,Human rights watchdog wants to outlaw climate ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô,"Yes I can't see anything wrong with letting the Govt decide what the truth is... Maybe we could have a new dept? Oooh, I know - we could call it the Ministry of Truth!! 

This is clearly (IMO) another attempt at the failed mis/disinformation bill.

Anyway, here's the text of the paywalled article:

  
A human rights watchdog‚Äôs push to outlaw ‚Äúfalse‚Äù views on climate change would crush free speech and become a shield to protect Labor‚Äôs green energy policy struggles, Australians have been warned.

The Human Rights Commission has told the Senate that ‚Äúregulation is necessary‚Äù to stop what it calls ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù on climate change that is delaying green action and denying Australians the right to a healthy planet.

The ARHC has claimed it would only want to muzzle ‚Äúfalse narratives‚Äù about climate change to the point it does not interfere with freedom of expression.

But the Coalition says the government would use green censorship laws to protect itself from critics of its climate target, and top marine scientist Peter Ridd warns it would silence anyone who ¬≠questions the government and the academic world‚Äôs orthodox view on the environment.

‚ÄúAll organisations (that) would crush free speech will claim to ¬≠support it ‚Äì and then come the ¬≠caveats which crush it,‚Äù Dr Ridd said.

Dr Ridd was controversially sacked by James Cook University over criticisms he made about his colleagues‚Äô research on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef.

‚ÄúThe fact is that many in academia and the extreme left-wing, government-funded organisations want people like me silenced, and some might prefer in jail,‚Äù he said.

The AHRC‚Äôs latest intervention said ‚Äúswift and decisive action is essential to mitigate the worst effects of climate change‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe right to a healthy environment is ‚Ä¶ an important aspect of human rights protection,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúAs climate-related risks continue to grow, there is a need for timely and co-ordinated action to reduce environmental harm.

‚ÄúStrengthening Australia‚Äôs response to climate change can help safeguard public health, protect ecosystems and ensure that all people can enjoy a safe, clean and sustainable environment.‚Äù

However, it said climate misinformation and disinformation could delay this action by ‚Äúsowing doubt and confusion‚Äù and ‚Äúerode public support and undermine trust for evidence-based climate policies ‚Ä¶ this can slow necessary action to address climate change.‚Äù

The AHRC nonetheless said this urgency ‚Äúmust not be used as a justification to categorise legitimate questions or concerns about the best way forward as misinformation and disinformation‚Äù.

‚ÄúCalling controversial opinions ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô or ‚Äòdisinformation‚Äô to shut down discussion, or making quick decisions without proper consultation, can damage public trust,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúIt also risks creating policies that don‚Äôt meet the needs of all communities ‚Äì especially those most affected by climate change.‚Äù

The ARHC rushed out a response from Human Rights Commissioner Loraine Finlay in which she doubled down on claims any attempt to tackle misinformation would impinge free speech.

But the commissioner did not outline what kinds of statements would be deemed misinformation or who would be the arbiter.

‚ÄúThe commission‚Äôs submission makes clear that in addressing misinformation and disinformation we must not stifle legitimate public debate. The commission has consistently emphasised that a healthy democracy depends on the ability to engage in robust debate,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúOur responses to the harms of misinformation and disinformation must be grounded in human rights principles and must not come at the expense of freedom of expression.‚Äù

Deputy Liberal leader Ted O‚ÄôBrien told The Australian the AHRC ‚Äúshould be focused on ¬≠protecting human rights, not ¬≠protecting Labor from scrutiny over skyrocketing power prices and missed emissions targets‚Äù. He¬†added: ‚ÄúHealthy democracies rely on open debate ‚Äì branding dissent as ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô looks like a shield for a government that is ¬≠failing to meet its own climate ¬≠targets.

‚ÄúAustralians have every right to question Labor‚Äôs broken promises and failed policies,‚Äù he said

In a submission to a Senate committee, the AHRC told Labor ‚Äúfalse narratives (on climate change) distort public under¬≠standing, erode trust in science and institutions and delay urgent climate action‚Äù.

‚ÄúMisinformation and disinformation undermine not only the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment ‚Äì but also rights to free expression and participation in public affairs,‚Äù the commission said.

The watchdog said misinformation and disinformation had a negative impact on ‚Äúinformed public debate and environmental advocacy‚Äù.

Further, false claims about climate change could result in ‚Äúdecreased support for climate change mitigation and obstruction of political action‚Äù.

As such, ‚Äúregulation is necessary‚Äù, the AHRC said, warning however that it ‚Äúmust not come at¬†the expense of freedom of ¬≠expression‚Äù.

The AHRC has previously been accused by the Coalition of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitism in Australia.

Liberal MP Julian Leeser ‚Äì now the Coalition legal affairs spokesman ‚Äì at the time accused the body of having gone ‚ÄúAWOL‚Äù since the Israel-Hamas war broke out and questioned why it existed if it ¬≠failed¬†to take a stand against ‚Äúracism and prejudice‚Äù, having failed to condemn the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",0.37,0,0,0,en-AU

I ask because I saw reports that Temu/Shein/Aliexpress items have a high risk of contamination from chemicals like formaldehyde and phthalates and can have extremely high concentrations of heavy metals, and even though I can't afford much, I was trying to avoid them because of that.

  
But if places like Bunnings/JB HiFi/Big W/Kmart are charging more but selling the same products produce under those same conditions ... Is there much point spending sometimes double the price?

  
Secondly, does that mean we should start being sceptical of the safety standards of items purchased from Australian retailers, too now? I'm not trying to be an alarmist I'm just so overwhelmed with what the best choice is to stay safe.",0.9,107,0,107,en-AU

AskAnAustralian,Expense of off shore detention in Nauru.,"Wondering if the general population writes to their representatives to demand changes. Do peoplegenerallyknow whats happeningor care? . I'm from the US and the 2 main  private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO group contracts are insanely expensive.  
The cost of the facility on Nauru is insane. Reading  that even before the contract, it was a mess with corruption. 
I was surprised to see the parent company is a US one. 
In trying to learn more about your beautiful country, I watched some YouTube video about immigration at the airports. I appears when you deny entry, people are put on the next flight out. Here in the US they detain them sometimes days with no real food, hygiene etc. 
When officers go to a house to detain people who have overstayed their visas, it appears they are civil.
Here in the states, all the border patrol, ICE, consistently slams people on the ground,  cuff them and injure. They are kept for months in horrible detention facilities and moved around so lawyers have a hard time representing them. 
I can see a harsh arrest for a known violent criminal fighting back, ,  but the violent arrests of construction,  restaurant workers etc are brutal. 
The private detention centers are costing way too much money and the people are treated like animals. The local animal shelter treats the dogs and cats better.

I'm at my wit's end trying to get this ring fixed. It's a gold signet ring with a diamond and a square black onyx inlay.

My original jeweller messed it up multiple times, leading to the onyx cracking twice.

AskAnAustralian,Why are the young people here so rude and immature?,"Edit: solely talking about my experience in SE Queensland 
I‚Äôve been living in Australia for a year now and I‚Äôve had such a negative experience with young people (like high school age to early 20s). For context, I‚Äôm 24 so I grew up in the same generation but have never met anyone in my life who act like the young people do here. They‚Äôve never personally done anything to me but I‚Äôve witnessed such immature behaviours from them. I have so many examples but I‚Äôll give a few-

Example 1: I was on the bus and these teenagers were sitting behind 2 Asian students. They started mocking their accents to their face while they just sat there in silence on their phones. And then as the students were getting off the bus, one Australian kid screamed out the window ‚Äúfuck off you ch*nk‚Äù. 

Example 2: walking along the beach trail and kids will zoom past you in their E-bikes without any regard for anyone else. I swear some of them are like 10 years old. I actually had a young male patient who got into an E-bike accident and I had to take their stitches out in their leg. As I was about to cut the sutures, he literally slapped my hand away and said ‚Äúfuck off that hurts‚Äù. The mom said absolutely nothing. I almost slapped the kid 

Example 3:
This group of drunk girls maybe aged 20 were walking down the street where my apartment is and they started smashing all of their glass bottles onto the sidewalk and then proceeded to laugh scream(?) hysterically and run off. I‚Äôm particularly pissed about this because we have so many dogs and children that live around here (not to mention all the people that walk barefoot to the beach). Also genuinely what was the point of doing that? It boggles my mind 

I have a lot more examples but I think you get the point. I love living here but these teenagers are ruthless and to be honest, really annoying! I swear on the weekends, all I hear are people screaming at the top of their lungs coming home from the bars. Like buddy we get it, you just had the TIME of your life at the pub, but why the hell do you have to scream the entire walk home lmao. 

Not to hate but just want to know is it like an attention thing? Is it just bad behaviour? Or is it just normal for these people to be menaces? I‚Äôm from Canada and although we are known for being nice, I‚Äôve definitely met people who loved to be shit disturbers in high school and uni. And I‚Äôve lived in the US  for a bit and have seen it as well but I swear Australia is unmatched.

AskAnAustralian,Question on a wedding gift expectation as a +1,"In short, I was invited as a plus one for a couple's wedding. I had only met them once before, but the couple getting married (girl especially) are close friends with the person who invited me. 

I agreed to being a +1, but as the date of the wedding approached, I was asked to contribute $100 (probably $200 can't remember exactly, but definitely at least $100). I was a bit taken aback as I didn't know that I had to contribute towards the gift for the couple. Mainly because I barely even knew them and wasn't really invited directly. I wasn't contesting that there should be a gift, just that I felt that it should be borne by the invitee. 

If roles were reversed, I wouldn't expect a +1 to contribute towards a gift for my friend's wedding which I was invited to and would also decline if they offered (whilst being appreciative of the thought ). 

I don't know if it's just the cultural norm I was exposed to (this was the first wedding I attended in Australia). In my head though it was less cultural but more logical, i.e. they aren't my friends, I'm not invited directly etc. Probably a bad example, but kind of like of like if I said ""Hey, I'm having a dinner at X restaurant for my bday, would like you to be there - I wouldn't have any expectation for the guests to contribute towards dinner and would flat out refuse if they suggested. Although I think this might be a cultural thing? Because I've been told in Australia the guests are expected to foot the bday meal? Anyways I'm digressing.

I just wanted to ask fellow Aussies, 

1. What's the cultural norm if you're a +1 for a wedding where you barely know the married couple 
2. What would the expected contribution amount be (how long is a piece of string?  ). Looking for just a ball park figure if it exists as there can be a lot of variables (socio-economic background, ethnicity, closeness to the couple etc.)",0.85,9,0,9,en-AU
AskAnAustralian,Emigrating with a baby,"Hey 

So my wife is Australian and we have been over recently visiting family and introducing them to our 5 month old

I am from the UK and my wife has ILR in the UK but with everything going on here combined with the larger support network of family we would have here, we are beginning to seriously contemplate a move.

I am 32, and her family are all based around Sydney and Wollongong. So it would be these areas we would look to settle too (or within an hour or two of driving) My questions are;

1) Once we would have sold up combined with savings we would have around 450 -500k AUD. I am aware this wouldnt be anywhere near enough to buy a house but would a plan of renting temporarily, getting a job and getting a mortgage be sensible? We might be able to stay with family for a bit but it would be just for a bit. 

2) job front wise, we both work in tech. Im a software dev heading up an AI/r and d focused team (predominantly python and .net, with devops) and she is in the renewable sector (python).

 Looks like the IT market is just as fucked in oz as it is everywhere else. Ideally would just slot in somewhere but I am not against another career change. 

Nursing (or similar) might fit my personality a bit better anyway. However, would there be any jobs or skills i could focus on potentially doing in the UK to make life a little easier when job hunting for the first year or so? 

3) I have a car automatic license. Would this translate to an equivalent or would i have to resit tests?

4) Does the visa type affect the healthcare i could receive or would i still be able to access some kind of reciprocal healthcare system?

AskAnAustralian,are my parents committing tax fraud under my name???,"Hi! I do not know where else to put this, so i hope this is appropriate for the subreddit? it got taken down on auslegal and legal advice so...  
My location: victoria, australia.

My mother and stepfather both make incomes in the top tax bracket. this year, I (18-19F), was told that they'd send money to my account and that I just needed to send it back. I found out that they (specifically my mother) put my account under their business so part of their income is automatically sent to me. I am not working for either of them, nor do i get to keep any of the money or benefit from it. I have to work minimum wage to pay for HECS, personal finances, pay for gas for one of the family cars, groceries, etc.

I didn't know this was potentially illegal until i spoke to a friend studying law in the USA today. My parents have told me that i can't get centrelink because then they can't send money to my account, and that to report my income when i start my new job so they know when to stop sending the money to my account. Again, i had zero idea this was illegal.

I asked my mom about it and she said this isn't illegal, and that everyone does it, but my google searches and inquiries with law student friends say otherwise, and i don't know what to believe.

It can be anywhere from 1k-5k a week sent to my account that i immediately have to send back. Is this illegal? do i tell the ATO? I have no other family or support systems and only work casual. I don't know what to do, or if this is even an actual legal issue or if i'm just being dramatic. Am i an accomplice???

Any and all advice is helpful! And i can answer any further questions if necessary.

Thank you!

EDIT: Thank you for all the support guys!! I just spoke with my parents, and they showed me stuff and explained everything to me.   
1. It's legal, like a few people mentioned in the comments. it's some trust stuff apparently. it is not tax fraud (from my understanding and what they showed me). Yeah, it's kinda dodgy and dickheady of them, but it's not illegal.   
2. they agreed to stop using my account. I'm going to close that account probably. I opened a new one esp because i'm starting a job that gives me more shifts (My current one is super stingy with shifts) next week. so that's a weight off my shoulders.

My main question is whether it‚Äôs realistic to go to the city just to see the famous Sydney Opera House and maybe a quick lunch at Circle Quay before heading back for my next flight. Nothing too ambitious, but I‚Äôve never been to Sydney so it would be nice to see the famous landmark.

The second question would be whether it‚Äôs better to take the train or the uber. I‚Äôm willing to shell out if it‚Äôs much more efficient, but if it‚Äôll take around the same time anyway (perhaps with traffic?) then maybe the train would be okay?

Open to any advice and ideas on what to do. Thanks!",0.75,6,0,6,en-AU

AskAnAustralian,"Has your standard of living increased, declined or stayed unchanged over the past 5, 10 or 20 years?","G'day everyone,

Inspite of the sunshine, which we have plenty, much of the data suggests that the underlying economy in Australia has been struggling for a long time. For instance, based on real wages\*, we are currently no better off than in 2010. Whilst our GDP is growing, fuelled in no small parts by population growth, our GDP per capita\*\* has been declining or stagnating at the best. Similar stories with productivity\*\*\*, which has stagnated for nearly a decade.

In hopes of going beyond the data, because not everything can be captured using economic figures, I was hoping to learn how do Australian people feel their standard of living has changed over the past 5, 10 or 20 years? Have there been particular episodes or time periods which have seen notable change, for better or for worse, in your personal quality of life? What are the main factors contributing to that? Let's have a friendly discussion.

I‚Äôm almost 19, I‚Äôm not in school and living in a very small rural town in NSW Australia. I just returned from a 3-month working holiday in the USA and it completely changed my life, without a doubt the best thing I‚Äôve ever done. After coming home I‚Äôve barely left bed. I was always extremely miserable here but after finally leaving I just can‚Äôt stay here any longer but I have no idea what to do now.

I‚Äôm not in university, this is my gap year, but I don‚Äôt even know what I want to study. The pressure is unbearable and I feel like I‚Äôm falling behind everyone else.

AskAnAustralian,Why do many aussies hate americanisms in language?,"Honest question. Is it any rivalry?

English is not my native and despite I learnt British English back in the day, I also had some influence from USA media and most recently Aussie culture, so my speaking is kind of mixed. But a thing that I don't understand is why some people seems upset when I pronounce a word or use a word the American way, some of them frown up and correct me, or some ask if I'm a yank, and I have to explain that I learnt from diverse sources. Even in this sub, I can read the complaints about the americanisms.

I feel like the reactions are disproportionate. My native language is also spoken in many countries, with its variations and it would never occurred to me to correct nobody's way of speaking. I can point out that in this country we use 'x' word instead of 'y' word but never with the bad temper that we can get here. ",0.42,0,0,0,en-AU

And then I literally emptied my handbag and there was no food or any sort of woolies item in it.

That's when the security guard believed me when I said I had no food or woolies stuff on me.

AskAnAustralian,How likely is this criminal harassment per Australian law Section 474.17?,"A few weeks ago, my phone got stolen. I managed to find the thief's phone number by tracking my lost phone. I have called him 300 calls in the span of 1 day at multiple times, including 100 calls at midnight, just to get him to give my phone back. I also spammed him with messages for a day. The thief only answered my calls 3 times in which he all swore at me right away and blocked my number. The rest of the calls either go unanswered or to voicemail box (I didn't leave any voicemail). Regarding the content of the messages, I never threatened him with violence, but rather sending him repetitive messages calling him a thief, citing local laws about theft and his own information (real name and date of birth retrieved from Internet). All of this only happened in one day and I stopped because the calls and messages were not getting him to return the phone to me.

**Addition:**¬†the phone number is indeed of the thief that stole my phone as in one of the messages he sent me, he admitted that he had the phone and really adamant that he's not going to return it.

Does this constitute criminal harassment per Section 474.17 ""Using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence""? How likely would I be prosecuted if the thief decide to report me to the police? I have reported the thief to the police, would they refuse to investigate it further since I have spammed calling and messaging him?

AskAnAustralian,Healthcare providers refusing to provide documents,"I‚Äôm encountering some issues with obtaining certain documents from my healthcare providers.

The place where I was diagnosed used to have a psychiatrist who made a diagnosis report around 4 years ago, but they no longer work at the clinic, and I‚Äôm unsure if they‚Äôre even reachable as they might be retired. The clinic does have a GP that I see, and they‚Äôve given me that same diagnoses report in the past 6 months, but I lost it in a move. I know it exists, though.

Instead of sending me the formal diagnosis report, they keep sending appointment notes made by the psychiatrist after the diagnosis, sometimes slightly modifying it to make it look more like a diagnosis, despite not changing the medical code smh. Not sure what they're playing at there. These notes are not a formal diagnosis, they‚Äôre just scattered/draft-looking follow-up notes from after the diagnosis, which is useless to me. I need this documentation as proof for applying for multiple different supports. I‚Äôve explained this multiple times, but they continue sending the same documents. After asking if they‚Äôve misplaced the original diagnosis report via email, I get the same set of notes again, with a statement that it‚Äôs the diagnosis (which it‚Äôs not, as I‚Äôve seen the actual report before).

Additionally, I‚Äôve been having trouble with a psychologist‚Äôs report. They gave me one to my GP, but it also got lost in the move. When I followed up and explained I need it, they say it's not acceptable as documentation proof, and I'll need (enter list of documentation), which I‚Äôve assured them I have and explained why I also need the extra details. Since then, I‚Äôve sent several follow-up emails asking if they were able to resend the report, but I‚Äôve received no reply.

AskAnAustralian,Complicated(?) IMG looking for advice for Australian Job,"As per title.

Complicated in the sense that I was a foreign student taking my MD in the Philippines, and was not allowed to complete an internship and thus not eligible for registration over there. (Their pathway is graduation -&gt; internship -&gt; board exams).

However, I have read in the standard pathway, it is possible to apply for limited registration as an IMG, and it usually follows after receiving a job offer, after which 12 months of supervised practice is required as well as AMC clinical examination or WBA is required for general registration.

What jobs should I be focusing my efforts on trying to find? I heard JMO/HMO positions are possible, and perhaps intern positions (albeit even more competitive). However, RMO is interchangeable with JMO in some areas, but they require general registration?
