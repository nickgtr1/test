As an insurance company which neither owns any infrastructure or manufactures anything physical, the E (environmental) bit is difficult to do anything about or improve. As for the G (governance), the executive team aren't willing to invest the time and expense of restructuring and we are already very highly regulated. Therefore that only leave S (social). 

It's been inexpensive to throw up a few rainbow flags around the office and implement WTC. It's shallow and meaningless imo but keeps our reinsurance premiums down.

"How sad for both involved. The push was retaliation rather than defence; but generally just a bad decision made in the moment.

A smackhead once flicked a lit ciggy end in my face, he was walking the opposite way so I turned ran up behind him and only after I closed the distance did I stop my self from punching him in the back of the head, likely breaking my hand and potentially killing him.

I've been in more than a few scraps, but I've rarely ever in my life been just that upset over something. I was pissed off because of having a ciggy flicked at me but that didn't compare to the days maybe even weeks after thinking  about how bad that could have been. To do something so stupid. Not only was it terrifying and horrible to think I could have killed him but embarrassing to think that I'd ruin my life and hurt everyone around me over something like that. 

That's a moment where I can say I truly grew up and if it had happened years before, as angry and aggressive as I could be towards people who I felt deserved it, I might have made the wrong choice.

"It isn't always about a sense of pride.

It is more about the market and what make sense economically.

For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players

Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.

Why?
1) The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.


2) Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.


3) Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost
