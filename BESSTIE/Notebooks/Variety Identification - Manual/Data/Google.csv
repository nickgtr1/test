Having the consistency of delicious taste is appreciated,1,0,1
lovely building. the stage is very good. the dressing rooms are very clean but the staff were a little unpleasant in the cafe.,2,0,2
"Good shop for bday celebration, snacks item. Good courteous behaviour of staff. But Coca-Cola items you should keep. Only Pepsi item not ok.",1,1,1
"Beef nachos and sweet potato fries on a Sunday avo. The nachos were alright, the beef could have been a bit less dry and a slightly larger plate would have been nice. The sweet potato fries were quite good, but that sauce was peak; could almost drink that straight.",0,0,0
"Decent hotel, good rooms but service can be better. Veg restaurants in ground floor good for south Indian dish. Restaurants on 6th floor is good for all. Waiters, receptionist can be more communicative to help customers. Parking slot is just 3 cars. Adjacent empty plot beside road can hold 8 cars.",1,1,2
Food items are good but not extremely worthy. Servicing is good as well as they do n't make you wait a lot. I felt the dine in arrangement was bit crowded and needed some spacing. Other than that Haldiram is Haldiram wo n't disappoint in taste.,1,1,1
"All was wonderful. The meat is to devour. The gyros wrap is a generous fill of flavour. With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future. Highly recommend. Such a pleasure talking to Andrew too.",0,0,2
"Nice budget pasta find, tasty, quick & hit the spot. Takeaway Good value, we did dine in for a little more Overall very happy.",0,2,2
"Chicken biryani awesome, can be less Spicer. Kabab varieties are very tasty. Expect a mutton Paya as welcome drink",1,0,1
"Really friendly staff and so accommodating to our needs. We were a large group that had to be out in time for the theatre but with our meals preordered, everything ran like clockwork. The food was delicious and we had a really social space so the perfect evening before watching family perform at the theatre. Thank you",2,3,2
"Great groups of people gather there, the establishment clean and friendly.",0,3,1
"Tasty food with reasonable price, I got good deal, thanks to swagruha foods",1,1,1
"Great tasting food, tucked away in a nice little place. Service was a little slow but the staff were friendly and helpful. Excellent variety of pizzas! Definitely something to suit everyone. The small plates were also quite good. Would loved a lot more variety on pasta choices but the ragu was amazing! All in all, definitely one to visit if you love authentic Italian food!",0,0,2
"I stayed there for about a week. Really enjoyed my stay there. Staff was cooperative. Had many options for breakfast like Aloo paratha, Cheese Sandwich, Kanda Poha etc. Dinner was also nice but unfortunately not a lot of customisation options were available. Rooms were a bit small but still were well maintained and comfortable. AC was okay. Housekeeping staff did a great job. Most important thing was the location its just a 5 mins walk from MSRDC bustop located near Vandana Theater.",1,1,2
"Convenient location with good main street views. My chicken burger was tasty and fresh. Gluten-free options are available. I dined alone, staff were friendly, and other diners started talking to me. A good place to dine alone or with friends.",0,2,2
Lovely pub but we only popped in for a cuppa. We really felt relaxed in The Roebuck & would definitely recommend it. We did n't have a chance to eat here so ca n't comment on the food. We were there around 10 am so it was quiet. The eveycould be another story.,2,2,0
"The pub which is in the city centre is open for breakfast until 12 noon and offers free refills( all day every day) on tea and Lavazza coffee. For lunch and dinner., there are lighter bites, with deli deal options and vegetarian choices, gourmet burgers and freshly made pizza as well. Nice place for friendly meetings.",2,0,2
"biggest advantage is walking distance from chennai central cost wise it's good but they add too much chilly, if you are not habitual of eating spicy food better to avoid",1,1,2
My favorite and oldest theatre in tenali,1,1,3
"It was a great place to sit in the shade and catch up with friends. The coffee was n't great, friendly staff and a good park for kids to play",0,0,2
"I've dined here before with family & friends & the food was enjoyable. However, during my small family visit yesterday evening at pm,( only 3 of us) something was off. The waiter was in mood or probably that s how he generally is, just rude, and the lamb karahi had a unusual taste & smell either old or off lamb. We had to self-serve get menus / Tissues from bar, used side plates, remind about drinks half way through our meal etc!( Worse experience ever!) My daughter just had a few fries and plain naan saying "" lamb is really nasty & vile "" Unfortunately, both my wife and I experienced stomach pains upon returning home. In hindsight, I should have stuck with Shere Khan instead! Or gone to Sultans a few doors up.",2,2,2
"Small, cozy place for quick bites, they have large variety of momo both veg and non-veg, this place has seating for 20 people small space but clean and good atmosphere.",1,1,3
"Absolutely appalling service, told us to wait 10 mins and ended up being over half n hour, uneducated staff and chewy food.",1,1,2
"Surprisingly easy to navigate safely( given its size), Victoria Square Tarntanyangga is a gathering place as much as it is an artery for movement through the city. Many events are received and / or hosted here( including sports events and holiday festivals). The parks are nice and many people recreate; partaking in health, fitness and family activities throughout the day. Victoria Square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful. More native vegetation would be appreciated but the open spaces must be preserved for practical reasons. One other thing worth noting is the cooling effect of this green open space. It is significant and airflow is definitely increased within the city because of it, which is important because Adelaide is prone to hot summers.",0,0,2
"Take away chicken spicy rice box with peri peri fries. Rice is hot but tasty, and the lemon sauce Is amazing. Really good food, great price, worthy of 5 stars. Would rate as good as nandos for taste, chicken is n't quite as high quality but the taste is epic! And the portions are great. The boxes look small, but are like dr. Who's TARDIS. 1 rice box is good enough for 2.",2,2,0
"We ordered roast of the day, Aussie burger, cc and midori cocktail. The service is quick, staff are very friendly. The food n drink are good.",0,0,0
"Tried their folded chili eggs() plus mushrooms and bacon( each). If I did not add the mushrooms and bacon, it is rather a simple overpriced chili eggs on an almost soggy bread. But with more flavours and protein in the mix, it was a good dish overall( minus the price point). Coffee was spot on, a little coffee art may help esp for weekend brunches after a long workweek( might be of a stretch for a suggestion I know, this is usual in Melbourne tho). Service was fantastic, staff were friendly and attentive.",0,0,0
Was a long time since visiting. Food is still as good.,0,1,2
"Unfortunately this branch has really gone down hill. For the amount we paid, I expected far better food and service. We waited a very long time for food and there were n't many people in there. The waitress was kind enough to come over and ask if we were told about the delay, which we were n't. When they food came the chicken was really dry and bland as though they did n't baste or season it on the grill. The garlic bread was rock solid it literally hurt my jaw eating it and gave me a headache. We did ask for some of the garlic breads to be replaced but the rest were inedible. We are n't complainers so we did n't say anything until we seen the manager at the very end. All he said was OK I'll let the staff know. I think maybe some of the order was ready and was waiting too long before serving which is why everything was dry and almost stale. It honestly is not worth the money, far too expensive and food very inadequette. Even the children said how bad it was. We wo n't be returning sadly. I am writing this in hope you can improve for others because people work hard to treat their families, and I would n't want others to walk away with the way we felt.",2,1,2
"Food was really awesome, quantity was also good but the service was late.. Hope next time the service will be on time.. Overall I loved the food And yes I would love to visit again",1,1,2
"Paid for a chicken big mac( more expensive than a normal beef big mac btw) through the drive through just and got home, took one bite and found that they put a beef big mac inside a chicken big mac box chips was hot though for once and the service from the girl was nt the greatest, she sounded like she could n't be bothered to serve talk. So not best pleased to be honest",2,0,2
"We were pleasantly surprised at this restaurant. It was clean, with modern decor and friendly staff and not too busy at 4 pm on the last day of term. Despite the extensive menu, my pizza was thin crust, delicious and served hot and fresh. The breadsticks dessert was a real treat, big portion with warm sticks and plenty of dipping sauce.",2,0,2
Although the bhang is not very costly but they do not use UPI for transactions which means they are doing some fraud and taking cash only.,1,1,1
"Its change in other name like this December 2020, Renovation in new concept and design at same place... Varieties of cake and stuff",1,1,1
"Visited the famous Indian Coffee House on Shimla Mall Road, known for hosting the Prime Minister. Tried the Masala Dosa — unique taste, not strictly South Indian but enjoyable. Highly recommend their delicious Special Coffee. The staff was attentive, and the evening crowd was just right. The spacious venue can host any group size, making it a memorable visit with a touch of history.",1,1,1
"To be honest, the food was pretty tasteless and bland, and the portions were extremely small... please do n't let my experience put you off trying it, BUT I certainly would n't recommend nor return to this place.",2,0,0
Went yesterday with my family for my birthday it was a great experience having dinner at biryani Darbar the food and service was really good thumbs up will visit next time soon!,1,1,1
"Having been back a couple of times since, it would appear my original visit was an off day for Costa. My most recent visit was lovely, calm, quick service, outstanding and talented staff, beautiful coffee, and delicious chocolate twists! Plenty of seats available, even though lots of seats were taken, and it was a clean and pleasant atmosphere. Some days it will be busier than shops on black Friday, and others it'll be like today. Know and plan your days and timings and you'll have a wonderful visit. With loads of free parking just outside as well, I recommend visiting!",2,0,2
"To the new owner of this Wagga subway, congratulations, but please keep the staff, this is the best subway in Wagga for service and fast get in and out with your lunch, the others are so slow and only ever have 2 staff on.",0,0,0
"You can enjoy a quiet walk alongside the Bremer River. Most of the pedestrian ramps were closed, possibly for renovation. It would be a nice place to visit once the pedestrian ramps are open once again. There is a free car park which can be accessed from Bremer Street. Toilets are available at the car park.",0,0,2
"Good selection of beers, was n't expecting Marble brewery in Lancaster. Dog friendly, spacious venue if not particularly interesting looking. Outside seating by the canal though.",2,2,2
Very nice Place. There is a separate room for a company. The room is equipped with air conditioning. Servis is so fast and Good advice on choosing a drink and snacks is right for you.,1,1,1
"Very enjoyable experience, however the current exhibition is a bit plain and low effort. Previously they have had much more interesting one afor the kids, like Lego car racing( with lots of big drops) or massive foam blocks from kids to build / climb with. Still, has lots of great modern art and a clay creation area.",0,0,2
"Nice party venue, good function rooms, busy place, friendly staff. Thanks",2,1,3
-Went for morning coffee before we visit the Mandurah Giants. There were 23 seniors who were happy to have coffee & cake after travelling 90 minutes on the coach. I had a coffee latte made with almond milk. The coffee was made just right. Cakes were yummy. Thanks to the staff who were very helpful & friendly. Service was prompt.,0,0,0
Fun quirky cafe that I have enjoyed going to over the years but have noticed recently that the service has gone way down. Today and other days I have been left standing at the counter waiting to even be acknowledged. I do n't mind waiting and understand being understaffed or busy but when staff are standing behind the machine / counter and avoiding eye contact while I waiting to order feels like I unwelcome and honestly makes me want to walk out.,0,0,2
This restaurant has a really good taste. The tandoori chicken here is juicy n full of taste. I had taken many parcels from here n ordered the same too. U get the same taste everytime. Biryani is also good.,1,1,1
"I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to. Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance …",0,0,0
Had Mexican for a change to usual stuff. Enjoyed each and every Nachos and the sauce-Red Chilli. Ended up having a clean take away container with nothing left. There was nothing that went to the bin other than the empty container. Tried Nachos with Chicken and looking forward to have other specialities they have like Burritos and Tacos. Friendly staff they have and lots of dining spaces..,0,0,2
Straight to the point. 2 stars because of less hygienic atmosphere. Plus no toiletries. Food is okay not so tasty that i will come often and not so bad that i do n't go back.,1,1,1
"The coffee at the shop was delightful, offering a rich and enjoyable flavor. However, I noticed that the environment felt a bit tense, which slightly affected the overall experience. Despite this, if you're primarily seeking a great cup of coffee, it's worth a visit.",2,0,2
"I recently stopped by this cafe in the Hunter Valley, and their chicken pesto toastie was absolutely fantastic, and the coffee was top-notch. If you're looking for a quick and delicious bite in the Hunter Valley, this cafe is the perfect choice. Do n't miss out on their amazing toasties!",0,0,0
Not local but was happy to stop for few drinks as the place seemed warm a d welcoming and busy on cold and windy night. Good beer choice. Cheep spoons prices. Tons of food options( sadly pizza was not available when requested). Friendly local crowd.,2,2,2
Turned down a small alley and found this gem of a place. Packed out even mid week. Nice little ornate place with copper topped bar and a good selection of real ale. I only had a drink but will be back for food and more beer,2,2,0
If you do n't want to talk or like others reviews are saying not welcoming with a smile. It is fine for me. But the chips were soggy and not cooked properly cause it usually crispy. It also gave me tummy ache. I had McDonald for a long time and was so excited. But you put me off. I will not recommend to go to this MacDonald and I never coming to yours even someone give me a money. I do n't put my health in a risk. Disgusted,2,0,1
Definitely a nice spot for lunch for a group of visitors. The coffee was excellent. The brunch options were good with fair prices. The tables outside were a bit dirty from previous meals. The service was fine.,0,1,2
"Ordered. Way. Too. Much! Everything on the menu looked so good so had to order as much as my eyes could eat. Did a couple of tacos, fried chicken, and the corn. Tacos were the definite stand out for me especially the fish tacos which were crispy fried and delicious! Not normally big on eating corn but this was pretty good, had some "" special "" sauce on the plate with this so paired well. The fried chicken was ok, by this time I was extremely full already! This is a schnitzel style fried chicken, which also has that same "" special "" sauce. Sauce definitely helped as some of the chicken was slightly dry. Overall with the sauce it was bearable. This place also has a few tables outdoor for seating, however not much of a view right next to the road.",0,0,2
"The worst weatherspoons I have been to. Staff standing around chatting. Waited 40 minutes for dessert to be delivered to table, having chased it twice. Was only a couple of scoops of ice cream with biscuit crumbled on top. Would n't eat there again.",2,2,2
"Not your coffee Cartel, but still very good. Staff always pleasant",0,2,2
They have very limited items in the menu The mojito was very sugary Peri peri French fries was really good crispy and spicy And chicken wings were also very well seasoned and crispy from outside,1,1,2
City view looks amazing from here. Britishers constructed it. Now it has gate and compound wall.,1,1,0
"We always get take away. The place is often mega busy. Food can be a bit hit andiss but the last few times have been fantastic. You can be waiting for a while if it's really busy, always seems to catch them by surprise.",0,2,0
Nice relaxed atmosphere. A perfect place for a coffee and a dessert after a walk in Esher. Plant powered breakfast sounds good. I love the pictures from the 60s. The furniture has seen better days.,2,2,2
Food was really tasty. Price is high compared to the portion. Very friendly stuff and excellent customer service.,0,0,2
Absolutely lovely service that was down to earth and served with a smile. Subs were well made with decent servings. Shops was relatively clean as well and the cookies were n't burnt. Keep up the good work!,0,0,0
When we walked in place was empty. We placed order 4 people working there or hanging around. Food was ready did n't even have the decency to bring it to the table. When we got the tacos it was Coldish only fries where warm. This was at taco bell in Mansfield. Not going to see me there again. Not saying taco bell is bad only the one in Mansfield is quite bad.,2,2,2
"I liked having the free self service storage locker for my small backpack. Definitely not a huge museum, but I did enjoy it. I was able to get through it in under 30min( I did n't read everything). Not something I would plan my entire day around doing, but it was free and a decent place to swing by if you are in the area. I did not make a reservation to visit the clock tower, so I did not end up seeing it. I personally do not enjoy guided tours.",0,0,2
"Visited on this cheap Tuesday during our brief stay in Wagga, after seeing all the good reviews. There were only two varieties of pies left as we arrived an hour and a half before closing, and both were delicious and affordably priced at each with free sauce( be warned though, the curry pie has a spicy kick!). The girls who served us were also lovely. I would n't hesitate to come back here next time I in Wagga!",0,0,0
"Great pub, great venue & overall 4 stars as a genuine rating. Drinks were n't a rip off and the band playing last Saturday took me back to the 80 & 90. Place was buzzing & I had a nice collect in the gambling lounge too. The only real dissatisfaction is relevant to the food. To be honest I picked out a couple of restaurants on Wharf St but my know it all mate said this hotel is the best feed in town. Possibly so but definitely not last Saturday night. Basic pub feed within a canteen like area. The seafood platters were less than good & way over priced. Apart from the food review I really liked the place, the vibe & location",2,2,0
"Quality of this place has degraded day by day. I used to be a regular customer to this place before. Now I shifted to some other outlet. Let me give you one example why I am saying so. I ordered 4 aloo tikki burger, I believe pizza baker were out of aloo tikki so they kept half aloo tikki in each burger. I thought may be by mistake. I ordered again, they were out of cucumber this time.",1,1,1
visited December 2023 A pretty typical grocery store. This place was fairly well staffed and clean. They had everything you'd need from a grocery store and plenty of other items. The self checkouts were wide open and everything seemed to run smoothly during our visit. Would go again.,0,0,2
"Was shopping last night in your store and the Personal Hygiene( Or lack of it) of one of your employees who was stacking your shelves was seriously disgusting. His body odour was so bad that I had to turn around mid aisle wretching my guts otherwise I would have spewed up everywhere, Not a good advertisement for a food store of a well known brand!",2,0,2
Spicy food delicious Service I rated 3 There are no seating arrangements. Location is good,1,1,1
Amazing restaurant... Tanduri lemon chicken is specially very good... off the main road amongst a number of other restaurants and all tasty and large portions... Must go! Highly recommended.,1,1,1
"This place has the potential of being one of the best pool clubs around, however, there are lots of areas that's needs to be addressed. Tables were recently reclothed( which is great) but what is not so great is the table maintenance. Tables are always very dirty and it seems that the staff do not care if they are clean and they certainly have no issue with customers doing there job for them by cleaning the tables. Staff are also very slow to clean empty glasses and bottles even when it is not busy at all. Customer service is also severely lacking. On multiple occasions we waited at the bar to be served while staff chatted to each other. Customer service is definitely not a priority. Also they have offers on drinks, but once again they failed to action the offer. Over charging us and when challenge before paying the response was there, there is nothing we can do about it as it being. Processed. So not only are the tables dirty, customer service is lacking they are also over charging clients, so always double check your bill. Other than those issues, could be a great club but they need new management",2,2,2
"Although it's not good for business, I've never watched a film here that has more than 10 people in the cinema. Staff are really friendly and helpful, but the snacks / drink are a little overpriced.",2,0,3
"I used to belong to the Stratford Picture House when it was a clean, nice place and the benefits were good. I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed( so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond. One can only assume it is out of their control and it is a case of poor facilities, lack of staff and no money available to make any upgrades. Such a shame.",2,2,2
"Got in here yesterday to the redhead women cleaning. Was unsure where to sit due to this. Sections were closed off, I have autism, so this makes me feel uncomfortable! Especially when she stares.",2,2,2
"The barman / manager was very welcoming. Bar was clean, warm with Sports screens, darts board and pool table.",2,2,0
"Conveniently located and open. Like the majority of convenience stores, expect to pay a premium on most goods. As of writing, they have a "" Cheap Tuesday "" promotion on lines to give them more competitive pricing. Also if you do a bit of searching you'll sometimes find a really great promo on something which may run for a few days to over a month at a price which undercuts the major supermarkets. Staff are genuine and friendly:)",0,0,2
Door was locked on three separate occasions that we went there. Tried to ring each time but went to voicemail. Pity... would of loved a map of Australia... obviously was n't meant to be.,0,0,1
Food took a little time to come out. I ordered « the big breakfast » meal for 25 and I got a decent size portion. It is however far worse then what I could make myself at home for a fraction of the price. The boiled eggs seemed like they been boiled without the shell as they were completely dry on the outside and looked like my grandmas skin. I mistook them for mozerella. Do nt waste your money here.,0,0,0
"Walked in, no coffee machines working. That have a McDonald style ordering machine so no people to talk to-good for McDonald, not good for a supermarket cafe if you ask me. Not the best cafe I been in so I did n't order anything and walked out. At least costa has people to take your order.",0,0,2

Lunch Rush hour Wednesday Roasted Masala papad Green salad Steamed rice long grain basmati Jhal fish made from fresh rohu fish. Amazing taste. Soft tender fish with excellent scrumptious gravy Licked the bowl clean Mutton kassa Gravy was good but mutton was chewy and leathery. Could have been better if soft young meat was used in gravy. Decent amount Fresh lime soda rupees. Burnt a hole in pocket for the amount received although good Overall experience Again gon na come back for the Jhal fish curry,1,1,1
Everytime I go there they never give my sons desert lolly. Quite annoying as he looks forward to it. Ordered my for got home the food was stone cold and they gave me the wrong sauce in my pita and it looked like it was dropped on the floor barely any salad inside and soggy from the sauce. Need to sanitise the cleaning equipment more often as they smell damp and stale at times.,2,2,0
"Service at the cafe was slow, additionally the order was completely forgotten. When it did arrive the drinks were spilled and no apologies were made. The staff laughed about their inadequacy and were overheard talking about how they were waiting for us to leave( I assume to alleviate their discomfort) Every job is important and should be delivered with professionalism and respect. Disappointed and a taint on our evening.",0,2,2
Best hotel full paisa wasul All dishes aur good and best service,1,1,1
Food quality not so good and do n't order combo dishes you will be cheated,1,1,1
"Foodwise: Steak and mushroom pie was OK. Quiche was very greasy. Coffee was mediocre. What perplexed me the most about this "" award winning "" bakery is there was not a single price anywhere for anything. You do n't know how much you are paying until you get the receipt. Seems innefficient to have to ask the server for a price on everything.",0,3,2
"Although I only had a chicken roll, and it's too little to judge a restaurant, I feel a quick snack here, is nice. The paratha was properly cooked, the chicken pieces were plenty, however the sauce was watered down, so the taste suffered. Had they provided original sauce, the roll would have been awesome, but it only rose to good. I would like to try other dishes and provide a better review, hopefully!!",1,1,2
"Dana eating house is an interesting fusion of Asian and Western cuisine. The entrees were interesting and got the taste buds buzzing, the smoked Peking Duck dish is the one I would recommend, this was a genuine suprise and one dish I would have again. The dishes that did n't really impress me was the char keow teow and chicken curry. The traditional flavours were overpowered or nonexistent. The staff were very friendly and helpful and provided good service even on a busy day. The dishes are priced slightly on the high end, but matches the quality of the dish Dana Eating House is presenting.",0,2,2
"The breakfast is really yummy and exceeds expectations. Loved it. However, there is n't much to choose from. The beverages also took a really long time to come out, they came just before the food and did n't taste that nice. Overall, really good experience.",0,1,2

One of the best Bakery houses in Guwahati. Variety of item available here. The salty items are too good. Their cakes are also of very good quality.,1,1,2
"Great restaurant and great service. One little hiccup, ordered a strawberry lassi. When they brought mango out, we said we ordered strawberry. The waitress tried to force it onto us and said we ordered mango, but one of us ca n't eat mango so we knew it was n't our mistake. This gave us a little disappointment in what brilliant service we got from the guys. Chicken wings was cooked just right, juicy, tasty, big and a very nice charcoal flavour. Liver starters, despite the liver having a rich taste to it it was yummy Lamb chops, missing that little something that we could n't out our finger on Family nan, light, fluffy great taste Curry, ok, chicken had a dry taste. Overall had a great night, would go back just for the service and starters... And to try more of the menu Thank you",2,1,2

The room stunk of cigarette smoke which lingeree throughout my stay even though the very nice lady on reception gave me a bottle of sir freshener. Bed was comfy and I actually slept very well.

"Large store with a good selection of groceries and non food. Hand scanners available for easy shopping visits. Jan 24, little has changed but the store is huge and not perfectly signed. Good selection of products though.",2,3,2
"Food is decent here at a reasonable price. The service is fast and people are polite. Also, the ambience is decent. The menu has a wide variety of foods but still some things are missing which will be added to the menu in the future. It was a good experience overall, must visit once.",1,3,0
"Looks like a very good meal, right ? Does n't taste that good. Akakura pappu is just for the name sake. Even the ghee does n't taste good. Rice is served piping hot[ maybe due to the time we visited, we were the first to order lunch for the day]. The ambiance is very good. Service is good. Food taste must be improved a lot. If you are looking for a fine dine place with average taste, go for it. If you want to taste the authentic Andhra meals, it's not recommended. Only veg restaurant. Gufha is upstairs for non veg options.",1,1,1
"Had our breakfast on a Sunday morning. Ordered the lamb burger for the man, ham sandwich for my little man and Egg Benny for myself. And a BOWL of latte to share. Lamb burger is quite special as we do n't see that a lot, but the taste is quite average. Good to see there option of ham sandwich for kids who not fancy with anything else. And happy with the price tag of.:) As for my egg Benny, it tasted quite good, but they should be more generous with Hollandaise sauce.",0,3,0
Best place for dinner outside of City Good atmosphere u should try for dinner,1,3,1
"If you're in search of an Italian dining experience in Stoke-on-Trent, look no further. This restaurant exceeded our expectations with its delicious offerings, including pizza, pasta, chicken steak, and delightful desserts like hot chocolate and brownie. The food was top-notch, and the service was impeccable. Highly recommended!",2,2,2
"Interesting museum in part of Bangor Castle which focuses on local history from bronze age to modern day. There's a nice exhibition on vikings and there's a replica of a viking longhouse to walk through. There's plenty to keep children interested and the climate change exhibition shows that the museum is keeping up to date with the latest topics of interest. There's a lovely cafe with indoor and courtyard seating and a great little shop to visit. The cafe is open everyday. The museum is free to visit and open everyday except Monday. When you've finished at the museum, you can walk around the Castle Park and the Castle walled garden.",2,2,0
Good place to read. Outside areas are pretty nice as well.,0,3,2
"A peek at the Linda Jackson exhibition at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery proved a riotous exploration of colour, landscape inspiration and textiles. The exhibition was well hung and curated to show the link between nature and landscape, the paintings, and the resulting textiles. Staff were warm, welcoming and friendly. Would happily return.",0,2,0
"Juicy burger, good portions. Best burger in the area, nothing compared to average pub ones or other burger places. We ordered smashed, they were n't super smashed but good. Chilly fries were yummy, but bacon cheese ones tastes like burnt onion, not like bacon bits on it. Cheese sauce was really good. A little bit expensive, but nice place and convenient location. Recommended, probably will come back.",2,3,0
Pretty good bar and restaurant though really it's typical pub food. But it was tasty and the drinks good and not too over priced. Service was good as well. It was mid week when we visited so at full roar it might be different. But a nice choice.,0,3,2
"Lovely venue and even lovelier staff. One star deducted for the sound system in the place... it seriously needs updated. The only speakers are at the front of the stage, so my advice is to always buy tickets for the ground floor. Also, the front row seats on the balcony are mad. There is no space to move past people if you're in the middle of the row.",2,3,0
"Taste wise no compromise but cost is high Hotel management should reduce the cost by 10 %-20 %, it will be better.",1,1,1
I'm very much disappointed the second time at first the food was awesome but the second i ordered food it was n't worth it at all the taste n packing also was n't good for the first time we visited it was way too much better than the second trust ua food n taste so they plan the second visit at the same place never disappoint them by this ever..... worst experience ever much disappointed..... i had taken butter naan with chicken kabab n biryani rice n some chicken masala and the butter naan was looking worst than chapati tht was soo dry ca n't even eat tht.....,1,1,1
One of the best hotel for non-vegetarian food in PALANPUR. Budget hotel. All dishes prepared very delicious and tasty.,1,1,1
First of all I like a good plate of Pav-Bhaji. But not many places offer a taste to my liking. We went here on the recommendation of a friend and it was very good. Butter Pav-Bhaji is especially delicious. Just few less stars for old and claustrophobic place. Although it was clean and tidy.,1,1,1
"I do n't take alcohol, the private function l attended at the Clarence could not supply any of the beverages that nowadays are readily available in pubs, eg good coffee, tea etc.",2,2,0
A perfect place for dine in with family. This is located at the heart of the town opposite of city centre. Visited three to four times here. Inside ambience was good. Bengali recipes are too good. Not all but some chicken recipes could be better. Cleanness and other services are also nice. Parcel and online order are also taken. Overall it's a restaurant.,1,1,2
"Great pricing and a good location, right in the middle of town with decent service. The food is pretty standard pub grub with some' flair'. Not much of a vibe though with occasional). Decent outside area with seating and tables.",2,3,0
Very tasty food and quick service. Good place to go for a family dinner!!,1,3,2
Interior and it has good ambiance but the food is worst and not worthy mostly pizza is not good in here,1,1,2
Excellent food. Have only been through the drive thru so can not comment on dining in. I will say the drive thru is a little tight on room even by Tassie standards. service is immaculate however. Recommend the nachos and quesadillas My partner loves the burrito!!,0,0,0
"This is a small, though very convenient, supermarket that keeps its shelves well stocked. Great selection of fresh vegetables & fruit. Still retains manned tills. We've been doing our weekly shop there for 10 years.",2,0,2
One of the best local street food in Baidyabati champdani area. You can have stuffed kachori along with Aalu and Soybeans sabji or Daal in the morning and Mator ghugni in the evening. Both tests i take parcel every Sunday for my family breakfast which is fixed every Sunday!!,1,1,1
"I really like the brisket and pork in a plate of bbq, so good. I think every meal that included chicken should improve, cause the meat are so tough to chew. This place is suitable for group of people come",0,0,2
"Catering for a 40th was great, staff were friendly, drink service was easy & a great view as well. Bouncer was a knob, demanding to see even though I had their wristband on & had been in the place all night. Other than that, it was tops.",0,2,0
"Visited Watford branch. Food, service and place was good. Quantity of particular dish was not as we expected. Ordered the same dish twice, first time it was good, but second time it was too salty. Now their main expertise-South Indian dishes were amazing-taste, quality, quantity, service in every aspect. We liked the fact that unlike other places they served 3 types of curries and sambhar. Totally enjoyed.",2,2,2
"Coming to this hotel for last 20 years, and it's still very homely, comfortable for stay along with tasty food",1,1,2
"Very neet and clean place, also come along with family and friends. Provide good service at very affordable price.",1,1,2
"Attended a wedding in the banquet hall. I found it a filthy place with a lot of maintenance issues. Cobwebs were visible in many places, the carpet was very dirty, the toilet floor was very dirty with thick layers of dirty, and wall panels were broken in many places. Provided heating system was very unsafe and had no warning signs.",2,0,2
"Extremely busy, tables were dirty, bit pricey too for a family of 5 for a fast food restaurant... but the food was amazing and plenty of it! We ordered the medium tenders and regular fries( nothing regular about them with the tastiest seasoning). The tenders were so fresh, a lot bigger than we were expecting, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. We will definitely visit again",2,0,2
Pizza was delicious over here. But the famous chicken schnitzel was not that tasty. Addition of a dip with the chicken will be a nice touch to it.,1,0,2
We are torists so were just passing by. Time for some refreshment. We had coffee and cake. The orange cake we had was delicious. We also ordered a ginger muffin to take with us in the camper. The staff were young and friendly. Fast service. With pieces of art on the wall and pleasant surrounds.,0,0,2
"Located inside the Agra fort Anguri Bagh has its own beauty. All the greenery was built as part of the Khas Mahal, which served as a place of rest for the emperor. It approximately 3 kms from the Taj Mahal.",1,1,1
Awful place Toilets absolutely disgusting Served a raw fried egg Waitress had dirt under there nails AVOID,2,1,0
Not a big temple but a big deity and very Divine. This is a Grama Devata temple at Palakollu. Lucky to be here for 60 years anniversary meal by coincidence,1,1,1
"A wide variety of games to play with friends including bowling, table tennis, air hockey & pool. There is also a great range of arcade games. It's a bit expensive but it's a great facility for Cheltenham.",2,2,2
Good Place with Variety of cakes. Try Chocolate Crunch and Gulkand Rose. Pastry are also Tastes good. Reasonable Price. Try Once,1,1,1
"Mostly very good. Lovely room. Nice greeting on arrival at 1 pm but room not available until 3 pm but that fair enough. Requested an extra hour check out the next day from 11-12 because my 8 year old was jet lagged and literally still sleeping but was refused despite the three hour window to clean the room. The place looks lovely and is nicely located with parking. Breakfast was pretty nice apart from the bacon being a bit dry, no orange juice and no side plates. Also I tried to order dinner at and the restaurant closed at at and they were unwilling to make anything so had to use Deliveroo. Pretty good overall though.",2,0,2
"Food is good as you'd expect from Little Wing but the service in the Bangor restaurant is really appalling. It's the third( and last!) time I've been-it took 2 hours for a simple lunch and it was n't even busy. Dreadful service, had to ask the wait staff to come and take our order, waited ages for food to arrive, one meal did n't come out until 10 mins after everyone else, we tidied the table ourselves and they got the bill wrong at the end. Not a good experience.",2,2,0
"One of our favourite pubs. We love the cosy inside seating more, but the outside seating is also great. They have a nice backyard seating too. Friendly staff. We also love the food here. The fish platter and the loaded nachos our favourites. The Scotch eggs, though not with runny yolks, were decent.",2,2,1
"Overall it had a good ambience, staff were nice & neat though it feels like they were over worked at some point. I love that i can see the kitchen. They clean thoroughly after each customer making the desk conducive for the next person. Pancake was super nice. The British breakfast was good. Kids friendly Dog friendly Wheelchair friendly Music was a little too loud",2,2,0
"Very nice cafe at the foreshore. You can enjoy the food either in the cafe or outside by the park. We had breakfast and it was ok, nothing fancy. I personally liked the vanilla chai latte.",0,0,2
