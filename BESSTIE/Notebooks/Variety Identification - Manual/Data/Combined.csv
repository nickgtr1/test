"Decent hotel, good rooms but service can be better. Veg restaurants in ground floor good for south Indian dish. Restaurants on 6th floor is good for all. Waiters, receptionist can be more communicative to help customers. Parking slot is just 3 cars. Adjacent empty plot beside road can hold 8 cars.",en-IN,en-IN,en-UK
Food items are good but not extremely worthy. Servicing is good as well as they do n't make you wait a lot. I felt the dine in arrangement was bit crowded and needed some spacing. Other than that Haldiram is Haldiram wo n't disappoint in taste.,en-IN,en-IN,en-IN
"All was wonderful. The meat is to devour. The gyros wrap is a generous fill of flavour. With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future. Highly recommend. Such a pleasure talking to Andrew too.",en-AU,en-AU,en-UK

The small plates were also quite good. Would loved a lot more variety on pasta choices but the ragu was amazing! All in all, definitely one to visit if you love authentic Italian food!",en-AU,en-AU,en-UK
"I stayed there for about a week. Really enjoyed my stay there. Staff was cooperative. Had many options for breakfast like Aloo paratha, Cheese Sandwich, Kanda Poha etc. Dinner was also nice but unfortunately not a lot of customisation options were available. Rooms were a bit small but still were well maintained and comfortable. AC was okay. Housekeeping staff did a great job. Most important thing was the location its just a 5 mins walk from MSRDC bustop located near Vandana Theater.",en-IN,en-IN,en-UK

Lovely pub but we only popped in for a cuppa. We really felt relaxed in The Roebuck & would definitely recommend it. We did n't have a chance to eat here so ca n't comment on the food. We were there around 10 am so it was quiet. The eveycould be another story.,en-UK,en-UK,en-AU

"I've dined here before with family & friends & the food was enjoyable. However, during my small family visit yesterday evening at pm,( only 3 of us) something was off. The waiter was in mood or probably that s how he generally is, just rude, and the lamb karahi had a unusual taste & smell either old or off lamb. We had to self-serve get menus / Tissues from bar, used side plates, remind about drinks half way through our meal etc!( Worse experience ever!) My daughter just had a few fries and plain naan saying "" lamb is really nasty & vile "" Unfortunately, both my wife and I experienced stomach pains upon returning home. In hindsight, I should have stuck with Shere Khan instead! Or gone to Sultans a few doors up.",en-UK,en-UK,en-UK

"Surprisingly easy to navigate safely( given its size), Victoria Square Tarntanyangga is a gathering place as much as it is an artery for movement through the city. Many events are received and / or hosted here( including sports events and holiday festivals). The parks are nice and many people recreate; partaking in health, fitness and family activities throughout the day. Victoria Square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful. More native vegetation would be appreciated but the open spaces must be preserved for practical reasons. One other thing worth noting is the cooling effect of this green open space. It is significant and airflow is definitely increased within the city because of it, which is important because Adelaide is prone to hot summers.",en-AU,en-AU,en-UK
"Take away chicken spicy rice box with peri peri fries. Rice is hot but tasty, and the lemon sauce Is amazing. Really good food, great price, worthy of 5 stars. Would rate as good as nandos for taste, chicken is n't quite as high quality but the taste is epic! And the portions are great. The boxes look small, but are like dr.

"Tried their folded chili eggs() plus mushrooms and bacon( each). If I did not add the mushrooms and bacon, it is rather a simple overpriced chili eggs on an almost soggy bread. But with more flavours and protein in the mix, it was a good dish overall( minus the price point). Coffee was spot on, a little coffee art may help esp for weekend brunches after a long workweek( might be of a stretch for a suggestion I know, this is usual in Melbourne tho). Service was fantastic, staff were friendly and attentive.",en-AU,en-AU,en-AU
Was a long time since visiting. Food is still as good.,en-AU,en-IN,en-UK
"Unfortunately this branch has really gone down hill. For the amount we paid, I expected far better food and service. We waited a very long time for food and there were n't many people in there. The waitress was kind enough to come over and ask if we were told about the delay, which we were n't. When they food came the chicken was really dry and bland as though they did n't baste or season it on the grill. The garlic bread was rock solid it literally hurt my jaw eating it and gave me a headache. We did ask for some of the garlic breads to be replaced but the rest were inedible. We are n't complainers so we did n't say anything until we seen the manager at the very end. All he said was OK I'll let the staff know. I think maybe some of the order was ready and was waiting too long before serving which is why everything was dry and almost stale. It honestly is not worth the money, far too expensive and food very inadequette. Even the children said how bad it was. We wo n't be returning sadly. I am writing this in hope you can improve for others because people work hard to treat their families, and I would n't want others to walk away with the way we felt.",en-UK,en-IN,en-UK

"Paid for a chicken big mac( more expensive than a normal beef big mac btw) through the drive through just and got home, took one bite and found that they put a beef big mac inside a chicken big mac box chips was hot though for once and the service from the girl was nt the greatest, she sounded like she could n't be bothered to serve talk. So not best pleased to be honest",en-UK,en-AU,en-UK
"We were pleasantly surprised at this restaurant. It was clean, with modern decor and friendly staff and not too busy at 4 pm on the last day of term.

My most recent visit was lovely, calm, quick service, outstanding and talented staff, beautiful coffee, and delicious chocolate twists!

Fun quirky cafe that I have enjoyed going to over the years but have noticed recently that the service has gone way down. Today and other days I have been left standing at the counter waiting to even be acknowledged. I do n't mind waiting and understand being understaffed or busy but when staff are standing behind the machine / counter and avoiding eye contact while I waiting to order feels like I unwelcome and honestly makes me want to walk out.,en-AU,en-AU,en-UK
This restaurant has a really good taste. The tandoori chicken here is juicy n full of taste. I had taken many parcels from here n ordered the same too. U get the same taste everytime. Biryani is also good.,en-IN,en-IN,en-IN
"I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to. Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance ",en-AU,en-AU,en-AU
Had Mexican for a change to usual stuff. Enjoyed each and every Nachos and the sauce-Red Chilli. Ended up having a clean take away container with nothing left.

Friendly staff they have and lots of dining spaces..,en-AU,en-AU,en-UK

If you do n't want to talk or like others reviews are saying not welcoming with a smile. It is fine for me. But the chips were soggy and not cooked properly cause it usually crispy. It also gave me tummy ache. I had McDonald for a long time and was so excited. But you put me off.

"Ordered. Way. Too. Much! Everything on the menu looked so good so had to order as much as my eyes could eat. Did a couple of tacos, fried chicken, and the corn. Tacos were the definite stand out for me especially the fish tacos which were crispy fried and delicious! Not normally big on eating corn but this was pretty good, had some "" special "" sauce on the plate with this so paired well. The fried chicken was ok, by this time I was extremely full already! This is a schnitzel style fried chicken, which also has that same "" special "" sauce. Sauce definitely helped as some of the chicken was slightly dry. Overall with the sauce it was bearable. This place also has a few tables outdoor for seating, however not much of a view right next to the road.",en-AU,en-AU,en-UK

"I liked having the free self service storage locker for my small backpack. Definitely not a huge museum, but I did enjoy it. I was able to get through it in under 30min( I did n't read everything).

There were only two varieties of pies left as we arrived an hour and a half before closing, and both were delicious and affordably priced at each with free sauce( be warned though, the curry pie has a spicy kick!). The girls who served us were also lovely. I would n't hesitate to come back here next time I in Wagga!",en-AU,en-AU,en-AU
"Great pub, great venue & overall 4 stars as a genuine rating. Drinks were n't a rip off and the band playing last Saturday took me back to the 80 & 90. Place was buzzing & I had a nice collect in the gambling lounge too. The only real dissatisfaction is relevant to the food. To be honest I picked out a couple of restaurants on Wharf St but my know it all mate said this hotel is the best feed in town. Possibly so but definitely not last Saturday night. Basic pub feed within a canteen like area. The seafood platters were less than good & way over priced. Apart from the food review I really liked the place, the vibe & location",en-UK,en-UK,en-AU
"Quality of this place has degraded day by day. I used to be a regular customer to this place before. Now I shifted to some other outlet. Let me give you one example why I am saying so.

I ordered again, they were out of cucumber this time.",en-IN,en-IN,en-IN

"This place has the potential of being one of the best pool clubs around, however, there are lots of areas that's needs to be addressed. Tables were recently reclothed( which is great) but what is not so great is the table maintenance. Tables are always very dirty and it seems that the staff do not care if they are clean and they certainly have no issue with customers doing there job for them by cleaning the tables. Staff are also very slow to clean empty glasses and bottles even when it is not busy at all. Customer service is also severely lacking. On multiple occasions we waited at the bar to be served while staff chatted to each other. Customer service is definitely not a priority. Also they have offers on drinks, but once again they failed to action the offer. Over charging us and when challenge before paying the response was there, there is nothing we can do about it as it being. Processed. So not only are the tables dirty, customer service is lacking they are also over charging clients, so always double check your bill. Other than those issues, could be a great club but they need new management",en-UK,en-UK,en-UK

"I used to belong to the Stratford Picture House when it was a clean, nice place and the benefits were good. I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed( so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond. One can only assume it is out of their control and it is a case of poor facilities, lack of staff and no money available to make any upgrades. Such a shame.",en-UK,en-UK,en-UK

The waitress tried to force it onto us and said we ordered mango, but one of us ca n't eat mango so we knew it was n't our mistake. This gave us a little disappointment in what brilliant service we got from the guys. Chicken wings was cooked just right, juicy, tasty, big and a very nice charcoal flavour. Liver starters, despite the liver having a rich taste to it it was yummy Lamb chops, missing that little something that we could n't out our finger on Family nan, light, fluffy great taste Curry, ok, chicken had a dry taste. Overall had a great night, would go back just for the service and starters... And to try more of the menu Thank you",en-UK,en-IN,en-UK

"The massive corpo I work for have rolled out WTC before each meeting because Lloyd's of London in the UK said they wouldn't provide us with reinsurance unless we improved our ESG score. 

As an insurance company which neither owns any infrastructure or manufactures anything physical, the E (environmental) bit is difficult to do anything about or improve. As for the G (governance), the executive team aren't willing to invest the time and expense of restructuring and we are already very highly regulated. Therefore that only leave S (social). 

It's been inexpensive to throw up a few rainbow flags around the office and implement WTC. It's shallow and meaningless imo but keeps our reinsurance premiums down. 

As someone who fully supports indigenous rights, opportunities and recognition, I'd be far more proud if my company paid for scholarships to young indigenous people looking to enter the corporate environment but that's expensive.",en-AU,en-AU,en-UK

"How sad for both involved. The push was retaliation rather than defence; but generally just a bad decision made in the moment.

A smackhead once flicked a lit ciggy end in my face, he was walking the opposite way so I turned ran up behind him and only after I closed the distance did I stop my self from punching him in the back of the head, likely breaking my hand and potentially killing him.

I've been in more than a few scraps, but I've rarely ever in my life been just that upset over something. I was pissed off because of having a ciggy flicked at me but that didn't compare to the days maybe even weeks after thinking about how bad that could have been. To do something so stupid. Not only was it terrifying and horrible to think I could have killed him but embarrassing to think that I'd ruin my life and hurt everyone around me over something like that.

That's a moment where I can say I truly grew up and if it had happened years before, as angry and aggressive as I could be towards people who I felt deserved it, I might have made the wrong choice.

"It isn't always about a sense of pride.

It is more about the market and what make sense economically.

For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players

Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.

Why?
1) The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.


2) Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.


3) Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost
